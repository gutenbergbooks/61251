<small>THE BABE OF THE LOG CABIN AND HIS KIN.</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Near five scores of years have gone by since a
poor, plain babe was born in a log hut on the
banks of a small stream known as the “Big South
Fork” of No-lin’s Creek. This was in Ken-tuc-ky and
in what is now La-rue Coun-ty.</p>

<p>It was Sun-day, Feb. 12, 1809, when this child came
to bless the world.</p>

<p>The hut, not much more than a cow-shed, held the
fa-ther and moth-er, whose names were Thom-as and
Nan-cy, and their girl child, Sa-rah. These three were
the first who saw the strange, sad face of the boy, who,
when he grew to be a man, was so great and good and
did such grand deeds that all the world gave most high
praise to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The folks from whom the fa-ther came were first
known in A-mer-i-ca in 1618. They came from Eng-land
at that time, and made a home at Hing-ham, Mass.
They bore a good name, went straight to work, had
health, strength, thrift, and soon tracts of land for their
own.</p>

<p>All the long line of men from whom this babe came
bore Bi-ble names. The first in this land was Sam-u-el.
Then came two Mor-de-cais. Next was John, then
A-bra-ham, then Thom-as who was the fa-ther of that
Ken-tuc-ky boy.</p>

<p>Though there was room for hosts of men in Mas-sa-chu-setts,
yet scores left that state and took up land in
New Jer-sey. Mor-de-cai Lin-coln, with his son John,
went to Free-hold, New Jer-sey. They made strong
friends there and had a good home. When more land
was want-ed, Mor-de-cai left his son in New Jer-sey for
a while, and went to the Val-ley of the Schuyl-kill in
Penn-syl-va-ni-a, where he took up a large tract of land.
John Lin-coln, the son, joined his fa-ther lat-er. Near
their farm was that of George Boone who had come
from Eng-land with e-lev-en chil-dren. One son of
George had great love for the woods, the song of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
birds and camp life. He was Dan-iel Boone, the great
hun-ter.</p>

<div id="i_007" class="figright" style="width: 481px;">
<img src="images/i_007.jpg" width="481" height="600" alt="" title="" />
<br />
<div class="caption">DANIEL BOONE</div>
</div>

<p>The men on Penn-syl-va-ni-a farms, thought it best to
buy land on the oth-er side of the Po-to-mac, so the
Lin-colns went in-to the val-ley
of the Shen-an-do-ah and
took up tracts on lands which
had been sur-veyed by
George Wash-ing-ton. The
Boones went to North
Car-o-li-na.</p>

<p>When John Lin-coln’s first
born son, A-bra-ham, born
in Penn-syl-va-ni-a, came of
age, he left his Vir-gin-ia
home and went to see the
Boones in North Car-o-li-na. Here he met the sweet
Ma-ry Ship-ley whom he wed.</p>

<p>Dan-iel Boone told them that there was a fine land
be-yond the moun-tains. Boone and three more men
had found a gate-way in the moun-tains in 1748. They
named it Cum-ber-land Gap, in hon-or of the Duke of
Cum-ber-land, Prime-min-is-ter to King George. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
found rich soil on that oth-er side of the moun-tains, and
the haunts of the buf-fa-lo and deer. Boone got up a
band of two score and ten men in 1775 and made a set-tle-ment
at a spot to which he gave the name of Boons-bor-ough,
in what is now Ken-tuc-ky.</p>

<p>When the war of the Rev-o-lu-tion came, the In-di-ans
had arms and shot which had been giv-en to them by
the Brit-ish. The red men fought hard for the lands
where they were wont to hunt. The white men had to
build forts and watch the foe at all points when they
went forth to clear or till the ground.</p>

<p>Still, more and more folks went to Ken-tuc-ky. Of
these, in 1778, were A-bra-ham Lin-coln and his wife,
Ma-ry Ship-ley Lin-coln. With them were their three
boys, Mor-de-cai, Jo-si-ah and Thom-as, the last a babe
in the arms of his moth-er.</p>

<p>From their North Car-o-li-na home, on the banks of
the Yad-kin, this group made a trip of 500 miles. The
end of their route was near Bear-grass Fort, which
was not far from what is now the cit-y of Lou-is-ville,
Ken-tuc-ky.</p>

<p>A sad thing came to the Lin-colns in 1784. A-bra-ham
with his three sons went out to clear the land on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
their farm. A squad of In-di-ans was near. At the
first shot from the brush the good fa-ther fell to the
earth to breathe no more. The two old-er boys got
a-way, but Thom-as, the third son, was caught up by a
sav-age, and would have been tak-en off had not a quick
flash come from the eld-est boy’s gun as he fired from
the fort, tak-ing aim at a white or-na-ment on the Indian’s
breast, and kill-ing him at once.</p>

<p>It was the way of those days that the first born son
should have what his fa-ther left. So all went to Mor-de-cai.
Jo-si-ah and Thom-as had to make their own
way in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Young Thom-as, at ten years of age was at work on
land for small pay. As he grew in strength he took up
tools, put by his coin, and, at last, could buy some land
of his own. When he was a man grown he wed Nan-cy
Hanks, who made a good and true wife for him.
He built a hut for her near E-liz-a-beth-town. In
a year’s time, the first child, Sa-rah, was born.</p>

<p>Two years went by, and as there was but small gain
and scarce food for three there, the Lin-colns went to
Big South Fork, put up a poor shack, a rude hut of one
room. The floor was not laid, there was no glass for the
win-dow and no boards for the door. In this poor
place A-bra-ham Lin-coln, II, first saw the light.</p>

<div class="caption">CABIN IN WHICH ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS BORN.</div>
</div>

<p>The moth-er, Nan-cy Hanks, when she came to be
the wife of Thom-as Lin-coln, was a score and three
years old. She was tall, had dark hair, good looks,
much grace, and a kind heart. It is said that at times she
had a far off look in her eyes as if she could see what
oth-ers did not see. She had been at school in her Vir-gin-ia
home, could read and write, and had great love
for books. She knew much of the Bi-ble by heart, and
it made her glad to tell her dear ones of it. The brave
young wife did all she could to help in that poor home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
The love she had for her babes kept joy in her heart.
Her boy was ver-y close to her. As she looked in-to
his deep eyes, she seemed to know that child was born
for grand deeds. As he learned to talk, his moth-er
hid his say-ings in her heart, tell-ing but few friends
who were near her, how she felt a-bout that son. But
she had too much to do to dream long. As Thom-as
was much from home the young wife had to leave her
babes on a bed of leaves, take the gun, go out and bring
down a deer or a bear, dress the flesh, and cook it at the
fire. She used skins for clothes, shoes, and caps. All
the time it was toil, toil, but love kept the work less
hard.</p>

<p>As the boy, A-bra-ham, grew in strength and health,
his eyes turned to his moth-er for all that made life dear.
In af-ter years he oft-en said, “All that I am I owe to
my moth-er.”</p>

<p>There was no door to the Lin-coln hut, so the
moth-er hung up a bear skin as a shield from the cold,
and pressed her babe to her breast as the chill winds
swept in be-tween the logs.</p>

<p>At the fire on the hearth the corn-cake was baked and
the ba-con fried. Game was hung up in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
fire, and turned from time to time, that it might all be
brown and crisp. When free from toil the moth-er
taught her lad and lass, and the “gude-man,” too, that
it might make him more than he was to her, to him-self,
and to oth-ers. The truths the moth-er gave out sank
deep in the heart of her boy, and in due time they put
forth shoots which grew to a great size, and were of use
to the world.</p>

<p>Four years went by, and then the Lin-colns took a
bet-ter farm at Knob Creek, built a cab-in, dug a well,
and cleared some land. The new home was but a short
way from the patch on the side of that hill on No-lin’s
Creek, but a good farm might have been made there if
Thom-as Lin-coln had been a man who would stay in
one place, and work the soil year in and year out. He
had not the pluck to keep a farm up to the mark.</p>

<p>When A-bra-ham was five years old he oft-en went
with his folks three miles from home to a place called
“Lit-tle Mound.” A log-house had been built there,
and a man found whose name was Rev. Da-vid El-kins,
and who was glad to come a long way through the
woods to preach from the Word of God.</p>

<p>The small boy soon had a great love for that good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
man. The ways of the child drew the preach-er to him
and they were soon fast friends.</p>

<p>Ere long one came by who said he could teach all
the folks to spell and read. A class was made up, and,
strange to say, the five-year-old A-bra-ham stood at the
head of it! His moth-er had taught him. She, al-so,
had told him to be kind and good to all. There were
sol-diers on the road from time to time, go-ing home
from the war of 1812. One day the young child saw
one near him when he held in his hand a string of fish
he had just caught. He gave all his fish to the sol-dier.</p>

<small>THE NEW HOME AND THE FIRST GRIEF.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>When A-bra-ham was sev-en years old, his fa-ther
Thom-as Lin-coln, found his farm too much for him.
What he liked best was change. He said it would
suit him to move to the West, where rich soil and more
game could be found.</p>

<p>He thought he would take what he could of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
poor goods, set off and hunt up a home. So he built a
frail craft, put his wares on it, but soon got on the
snags and lost most of what he had. He swam to the
shore. In a few days the wa-ters, which had come up
as high as the banks, went down, and folks a-long shore
helped him get up a few of his goods from the bot-tom
of the riv-er. These goods he put in-to a new boat, which
he said he would pay for as soon as he could, and then
float-ed down the O-hi-o to Thomp-son’s Land-ing.
Here he put what he had brought with him in-to a store-house,
and went off a score of miles through the woods
to Pig-eon Creek. He found the soil all he thought it
would be. He chose a tract of land, and then made a
long trip to “en-ter his claim” at Vin-cennes. The next
thing to do was to go back to Ken-tuc-ky.</p>

<p>The cool days of No-vem-ber had come ere wife and
chil-dren, with two hor-ses which a friend had loaned,
and what goods were left, set out for the far off land of
In-di-an-a. When night came they slept on the ground
on beds made of leaves and pine twigs. They ate the
game the ri-fles brought down, cooking it by the camp
fire. From time to time they had to ford or swim streams.
They were glad that no rain fell in all their long route.</p>

<div class="caption">ON THE WAY TO INDIANA.</div>
</div>

<p>Sa-rah and A-bra-ham thought it was nice to spend
weeks in the free, wild life of the woods. A-corns and
wal-nuts they found, and fish came up when they put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a fat worm on their hooks. They could wade and swim
in the cool brooks and gather huge piles of dried leaves
for their sound sleep at night.</p>

<p>But at last they came to the banks of one stream from
which they could look far off to the land where they
were to make their new home. All was still there save
the sound of the birds and small game. Right in-to the
heart of the dense woods they went on a piece of tim-ber-land
a mile and a half east of what is now Gen-try-ville,
Spen-cer Co. This was A-bra-ham Lin-coln’s
third home. Here his fa-ther built a log “half-face,”
half a score and four feet square. It had no win-dows
and no chim-ney. For more than twelve months the
Lin-colns staid in this camp. They got a bit of corn
from a patch, and ground it in-to meal at a hand grist-mill,
sev-en miles off, and this was their chief food.
There was, of course, game, fish, and wild fruits.</p>

<p>Their beds were still heaps of dry leaves. The lad
slept in a small loft at one end of the cab-in to which he
went up by means of pegs in the wall. A-bra-ham was
then in his eighth year, tall for his age, and clad in a
home-spun garb or part skins of beasts. The cap was
made of the skin of a coon with the tail on. The child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
did much work. He knew the use of the axe, the
wedge, and the maul, and with these he found out how
to split rails from logs drawn out of the woods. To clear
the land so that they could plant corn to feed the fam-i-ly,
and hew tim-ber to build the new house was work
that gave fa-ther and son much to do. At last Sa-rah
and A-bra-ham felt that they had a house to be proud
of, though it was not much bet-ter than the one they had
left. Its floor had not been laid, and there were no
boards of which to make the door when they moved in.
Some friends had come to see them, and as there would
be more room for them in the new house they went to
live there. It was a glad day when Thom-as Spar-row,
whose wife was Mr. Lin-coln’s sis-ter, and Den-nis
Hanks, her nephew, came.</p>

<div class="caption">GOING UP TO THE LOFT.</div>
</div>

<p>The brief joy of the Lin-colns was soon lost in a
great grief. An ill-ness came to that place and man-y
folks died. Mrs. Lin-coln fell sick. She knew that she
must leave her dear ones. Her work was at an end.
As her son stood at her bed-side she said, “A-bra-ham,
I am go-ing a-way from you. I shall not come back. I
know that you will be a good boy, that you will be kind
to Sa-rah and to your fa-ther. I want you to live as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
have taught you, and to love
your Heav-en-ly Fa-ther.”</p>

<p>The grief that came then to
A-bra-ham Lin-coln made its
mark on him, a stamp that
went with him through life.</p>

<p>When that moth-er died,
that dear moth-er, to whom he
gave so much love, the boy
felt that he did not want to
live an-y long-er. He thought
his heart would break. He
staid days by his moth-er’s
grave. He could not eat. He
could not sleep. Soon Mr.
and Mrs. Spar-row, the guests,
died. The strange ill-ness
came to them. It came, al-so,
e-ven to the beasts of the fields in that land. Those
were sad days.</p>

<p>Nan-cy Hanks Lin-coln was 33 years old when she
died. Her hus-band, Thom-as, made a cof-fin for her of
green lum-ber cut with a whip-saw, and she, with oth-ers,
was bur-ied in a small “clear-ing” made in the woods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
There were no pray-ers or hymns. It was great grief
to young A-bra-ham that the good man of God who
spoke in the old home was not there to say some words
at that time. It was then that the ten-year old child
wrote his first let-ter. It was hard work, for he had had
small chance to learn that art. But his love for his
moth-er led his hand so that he put down the words on
pa-per, and a friend took them five scores of miles off.
Good Par-son El-kins took the poor note sent from the
boy he loved, and, with his heart full of pit-y for the
great grief which had come to his old friends, and be-cause
of his deep re-gard for the no-ble wom-an who had
gone to her rest, he made the long jour-ney, though
weeks passed ere he could stand by that grave and say
the words A-bra-ham longed to hear.</p>

<small>READING BY THE FIRELIGHT; THE NEW MOTHER;
THE FIRST DOLLAR.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>With moth-er gone, Sa-rah Lin-coln must keep the
house, do the work, sew and cook for fa-ther and
broth-er. She was 11 years old. The boy did his part
but though he kept a bright fire on the hearth, it was
still a sad home when moth-er was not there.</p>

<p>Books came to give a bit of cheer. An a-rith-me-tic
was found in some way and al-so a co-py of Æ-sop’s
Fa-bles. For a slate a shov-el was used. For a pen-cil
a charred stick did the work.</p>

<p>A year went by, and one day Thom-as Lin-coln left
home. He soon came back and brought a new wife
with him. She was Sa-rah Bush John-ston, an old
friend of E-liz-a-beth-town days. She had three chil-dren—John,
Sa-rah and Ma-til-da. A kind man took them
and their goods in a four-horse cart way to In-di-an-a.</p>

<p>A great change then came to the Lin-coln house.
There were three bright girls and three boys who made a
deal of noise. A door was hung, a floor laid, a win-dow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
put in. There were new chairs, a bu-reau, feath-er-beds,
new clothes, neat ways, good food, lov-ing care, and
much to show A-bra-ham that there was still some hope
in the world.</p>

<p>The new moth-er was a kind wom-an, and at once
took the sad boy to her heart. All his life from that
time, he gave praise to this friend in need.</p>

<p>A chance came then for a brief time at school, and
this was “made the most of.” Folks said the boy “grew
like a weed.” When he was twelve it was said one
“could al-most see him grow.” At half a score and five
years old he was six feet and four in-ches high. He
was well, strong, and kind. He had to work hard. He
did most of the work his fa-ther should have done. But
in the midst of it all he found time to read. He kept
a scrap-book, too, and put in it verse, prose, bits from
his-to-ry, “sums,” and all print and writ-ing he wished
to keep. At night he would lie flat on the floor and
read and “fig-ure” by fire light.</p>

<p>One day some one told A-bra-ham that Mr. Craw-ford,
a man whose home was miles off, had a book he
ought to read. This was a great book in those days.
It was Weems’ “Life of Wash-ing-ton.” The youth set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
off through the woods to ask the loan of it. He got
the book and read it with joy. At night he put it in
what he thought was a
safe place be-tween the
logs, but rain came in
and wet it, so he went
straight to Craw-ford,
told the tale, and worked
three days at “pull-ing
fod-der” to pay for the
harm which had come to
the book.</p>

<div class="caption">THE YOUNG RAIL-SPLITTER.</div>
</div>

<p>It was the way
in those times in
that place for a
youth to work
till he was a
score and one
years old for his
fa-ther. This young Lin-coln did, work-ing out where
he would build fires, chop wood, “tote” wa-ter, tend ba-bies,
do all sorts of chores, mow, reap, sow, plough,
split rails, and then give what he earned to his fa-ther.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Though work filled the days, much of the nights were
giv-en to books. In rough garb, deer skin shoes, with a
blaze of pine knots on the hearth, A-bra-ham read, read,
fill-ing his mind with things that were a help to him all
his life. He knew how to talk and tell tales, and folks
liked to hear him. He led in all out of door sports.
He was kind to those not so strong as he was. All
were his friends.</p>

<p>The first mon-ey that he thought he might call his own
he earned with a boat he had made. It seems that one
day as he stood look-ing at it and think-ing if he could
do an-y thing to im-prove it, two men drove down to the
shore with trunks. They took a glance at some boats
they found there, chose Lin-coln’s boat, and asked him
if he would take men and trunks out to the steam-er.
He said he would. So he got the trunks on the flat-boat,
the men sat down on them, and he sculled out to
the steam-er.</p>

<div id="i_032fp" class="figcenter" style="width: 462px;">

<br />
<div class="caption">EARNING THE FIRST DOLLAR.</div>
</div>

<p>The men got on board the steam-er, and their young
boat-man lift-ed the hea-vy trunks to her deck. Steam
was put on, and in an in-stant the craft would be gone.
Then the youth sang out that his pas-sen-gers had not
yet paid him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Each man then took from his pock-et a sil-ver half-dol-lar
and threw it on the floor of the flat-boat. Great
was the sur-prise of young Lin-coln to think so much
mon-ey was his for so lit-tle work. He had thought
“two or three bits” would be a-bout right. The
coin which came to him then, when off du-ty from his
fa-ther’s toil, the youth thought might be his own. It
made him feel like a man, and the world then was more
bright for him.</p>

<p>A man who kept a store thought he would send a
“car-go load,” ba-con, corn meal, and oth-er goods, down
to New Or-leans in a large flat-boat. As A-bra-ham
was at all times safe and sure, the own-er, Mr. Gen-try,
asked him to go with his son and help a-long. They had to
trade on the “su-gar-coast,” and one night sev-en black
men tried to kill and rob them. Though the young
sail-ors got some blows, they at last drove off the ne-groes,
“cut ca-ble,” “weighed an-chor,” and left. They
went past Nat-chez, an old town set-tled by the French
when they took the tract which is now Lou-is-i-an-a.
The hou-ses were of a strange form to the boat-men.
The words they heard were in a tongue they did not
know. They passed large plan-ta-tions, and saw groups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of huts built for the slaves. At New Or-leans, in the
old part of the town where they staid, all things were
so odd that it seemed as if they were in a land be-yond
the great sea. When they had left their car-go in its
right place, they went back to In-di-an-a, and Mr. Gen-try
thought they had done well.</p>

<p>A-bra-ham had more to think of when he came home.
He had seen so much on his trip that the world was
not quite the same to him. Scores of flat-boats were
moored at lev-ees, steam-boats went and came, big ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
were at an-chor in the riv-er. Men were there who
sailed far o-ver the seas in search of gold, rich goods,
sights of pla-ces, tribes and climes to which Lin-coln
had not giv-en much thought. If oth-er men went out
in-to the world, why might he not go? Why stay in
this dull place and toil for naught? He had come to an
age in which there was un-rest. His fa-ther’s wish was
that he should push a plane and use a saw all his days.
This sort of work did not suit him. Why not strike
out? Then the thought came to him that his time was
not yet his own. His moth-er’s words spoke to him as
they did when he was a small boy at her bed-side for
the last time; “Be kind to your fa-ther.”</p>

<small>THE SLAVE SALE. LINCOLN AS SOLDIER, POSTMASTER,
SURVEYOR, AND LAWYER.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>One day a let-ter came to Thom-as Lin-coln. It bore
the post-mark of De-ca-tur, Ill. It said that Il-li-nois
was a grand state: “The soil is rich and there are trees
of oak, gum, elm, and more sorts, while creeks and riv-ers
are plen-ty.” It al-so told that “scores of men had
come there from Ken-tuc-ky and oth-er states, and that
they would all soon get rich there.”</p>

<p>To Thom-as Lin-coln this was good news. He was
glad of a chance to make an-oth-er home. He
knew, too, that the same sick-ness which took his first
wife from him had come back, and that he must make
a quick move if he would save those who were left. This
was in March, 1830, when A-bra-ham was a score and
one years old. He made up his mind to see his folks
to their new home since go they would.</p>

<p>Then came an auc-tion, or, as they called it, a “van-doo.”
The corn was sold; the farm, hogs, house goods,
all went to those folks who would give the most for them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Four ox-en drew a big cart which held half a score and
three per-sons, the Hanks, the Halls, and Lin-colns.
They had to push on through mud, and cross streams
high from fresh-ets. A-bra-ham held the “gad” and
kept the beasts at their task. With him the young man
took a small stock of thread, pins, and small wares which
he sold on the way. When half a score and five days
had gone by the trip came to an end. The spot for a
home was found when all were safe in Il-li-nois and it
was on the north fork of the San-ga-mon Riv-er, ten
miles west of the town of De-ca-tur.</p>

<p>The young men went to work and made clear half a
score and five a-cres of land and split the rails with
which to fence it. There was no one who could swing
an axe like A-bra-ham, not one in the whole West. He
could now “have his own time” for his 21 years of
work for his fa-ther were at an end. The law said he
was free. Though he need not now give all that he
won by toil to his folks, still he did not let them want.
To the end of his life he gave help to his kin, though
he was far from rich.</p>

<p>When Spring had gone by, and the warm days of
1830 had come, A-bra-ham Lin-coln left home and set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
off to get a job in that new land. He saw new farms
with no fen-ces. He was sure that his axe could cut
up logs and fell trees. He was in need of clothes. So
he split 400 rails for each yard of “blue jeans” to make
him a pair of trou-sers. The name of “rail-split-ter,”
came to him. He knew that he could do this work well.
All he met would at once like him. It was the same
way in the new state as it had been in the last.</p>

<p>There was a man whose name was Of-futt. He saw
what young Lin-coln was. He knew he could trust him
to do all things. Mr. Of-futt said he must help sail a
flat-boat down the Mis-sis-sip-pi riv-er to New Or-leans.
He said he would give the new hand fif-ty cents a day.
Poor A-bra-ham thought this a large sum. Of-futt said
too, that he would give a third share in six-ty dol-lars to
each of his three boat-men at the end of the trip. At a
saw-mill near San-ga-mon-town the flat-boat was built.
Young Lin-coln worked on the boat, and was cook too,
for the men.</p>

<p>At last they were off with their load of pork, live
hogs, and corn. When the flat-boat ran a-ground at
New Sa-lem, and there was great risk that it would be
a wreck, Lin-coln found a way to get it off. Folks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
stood on the banks and cheered at the wise plan of the
bright boat-man.</p>

<div class="caption">THE FLAT-BOAT AND ITS CREW ON THE WAY TO NEW ORLEANS.</div>
</div>

<p>When first in New Or-leans, though Lin-coln had
seen slaves, he had not known what a slave sale was
like. This time he saw one and it made him sick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Tears stood in his eyes. He turned from it and said to
those with him, “Come a-way, boys! If I ev-er get a
chance, some day, to hit that thing,” (here he flung his
long arms to-ward that block), “I’ll hit it hard!”</p>

<p>The boat-men made their way home, while Of-futt
staid in St. Lou-is to buy goods for a new store that he
was to start in New Sa-lem. First A-bra-ham went to
see his fa-ther and help him put up a house of hewn
logs, the best he had ev-er had.</p>

<p>When Of-futt’s goods came A-bra-ham Lin-coln took
his place as clerk. The folks who came to buy soon
found out that there was one in that store who would
not cheat. The coins at that time were Eng-lish or
Span-ish. The clerk was ex-act in fig-ures, but if a
chance frac-tion went wrong he would ride miles to
make it right.</p>

<div class="caption">LINCOLN AS CLERK IN OFFUTT’S STORE.</div>
</div>

<p>There were rough men and boys near that store.
Lin-coln would not let them say or do things that were
low and bad. The time came when he had to whip
some of them. He taught them a les-son. His great
strength was his own and his friends’ pride.</p>

<p>Days there were when small trade came to the store.
Then the young clerk read. One thing he felt he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
must have. That was a gram-mar. He had made up
his mind that since he could talk he would learn to use
the right words. He took a walk of some miles to get
a loan of “Kirk-ham’s Gram-mar.” He had no one to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
teach him, but he gave his mind to the work and did
well. Each book of which he heard in New Sa-lem,
he asked that he might have for a short time. He
found out all that the books taught. Once, deep down
in a box of trash, he found two old law books. He was
glad then, and said he would not leave them till he got
the “juice” from them. Folks in the store thought it
strange that the young clerk could like those “dry
lines.” They soon said that A-bra-ham Lin-coln had
long legs, long arms, and a long head, too. They felt
that he knew more than “an-y ten men in the set-tle-ment,”
and that he had “ground it out a-lone.” He
read the news-pa-pers a-loud to scores of folks who had
a wish to know what went on in the land and could not
read for them-selves. He read and spoke on the
themes of the day, and at last, his friends said that he
ought to help make the state laws, since he knew so
much, and they felt that he would be sure to plan so
that the poor as well as the rich should have a chance.
So in March, 1832, it was known that A-bra-ham’s
name was brought up as a “can-di-date” for a post in
the Il-li-nois State Leg-is-la-ture. Ere the time for e-lec-tion
came, that part of the land found men must be sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to fight the In-di-ans who were on the war-path. The
great chief, Black Hawk, sought to keep the red men’s
lands from the white folks, but at last he had to give
up, though he did all he could to help his own blood.
He was brave and true to his own.</p>

<p>Young men of San-ga-mon went out to fight, with
A-bra-ham Lin-coln as cap-tain. They were not much
more than an armed mob, poor at drill, and with not
much will to mind or-ders or live up to camp rules.
Their cap-tain had hard work to gov-ern them, for when
he gave a com-mand they were as apt to jeer at it as to
mind it. But in time they learned that he meant what
he said, and that while it was not his way to be too
strict a-bout small things, he would not let them do a
grave wrong.</p>

<p>One day a poor old In-di-an strayed in-to the camp.
He had a pass from Gen-er-al Cass which said that he
was a friend of the whites, but the men had come out
to kill red-skins, and not hav-ing yet had a chance to do
so, thought they must seize this one. They said the
pass was forged, and that the old man was a spy, and
should be put to death.</p>

<p>But Cap-tain Lin-coln heard the noise, and came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the aid of the old man just in time. He put him-self
be-tween his men and their vic-tim, and told them they
must not do this thing. They were so full of wrath
that Lin-coln’s own life was at risk for a while, but his
brave look and firm words at length brought them to
terms, and the old sav-age was let go with-out harm.</p>

<p>The time for which the men had en-list-ed was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
at an end, and all but two of them went home. Lin-coln
was one of those who took a place as a pri-vate in
an-oth-er com-pa-ny, and he did not leave till the end of
the war.</p>

<p>A-bra-ham Lin-coln, when he had got home from
the war, sent out word that he would speak where there
was need of him as “Whig,” for he was a “Clay man
through and through.” He made his first “po-lit-i-cal”
speech at a small place a few miles west of Spring-field.
It was a short one. While what he said was to the point
and no fault could be found with it, still, his strange
looks and queer clothes made those who were not on
his side laugh and make fun of his long legs and arms,
and say he would not be the choice of the most for an-y
post. Still, he made more friends than foes, and though
he did not, at that time, get a chance to go to the Leg-is-la-ture,
he had but to wait a while when bet-ter luck
came to him.</p>

<p>In the mean time Mr. Lin-coln knew that he must
find work of some kind, for he had no funds on which
he could live. He then kept a store with a man, but
the gain was small and at last they had to give up.
There was a large debt and the part-ner would not help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
pay it, so Lin-coln took it all on him-self, though long
years went by ere it was all paid.</p>

<p>Law came to him as the next best move, and once
more the young man gave his mind to it all his time,
days as well as most of
the nights. But coin
could not come from
that source for quite
a while yet, and, in
the mean-time, there
must be food and
clothes.</p>

<p>The new lands, just
there, had not been
sur-veyed. There was
need of a man to do
this. Lin-coln heard
of a book which would
tell him how to work
with chain and rule. He spent six weeks with that
book in his hand most of the time. Then he set off to
start work, and as he was too poor to buy a chain, he
found a strong grape vine to take its place. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
right glad of the sums which came to him then for
do-ing this work.</p>

<p>The pres-i-dent of the U. S. at that time was An-drew
Jack-son. He was a strong friend of A-bra-ham Lin-coln
and made him Post-mas-ter of New Sa-lem in 1833.</p>

<p>As folks did not write much in those days, the post
of-fice took but a small part of Mr. Lin-coln’s time.
The news-pa-pers which came by post were read, and
passed from one to an-oth-er, and the post-mas-ter oft-en
told the news as he went to the hou-ses where let-ters
were to be left. The hat took the place of a mail bag.
The grape vine chain and the tools with which the
length and breadth of the land were found went a-long,
too, as the good man took up his job at sur-vey-ing. Law
books must have their share of time and that had to
come then, most-ly from sleep hours. There were
scores of folks who asked the post-mas-ter to help them.
This he did with great good will. He now knew some
law and could set them right. All had trust in him.
It was not long, then, ere he was at the Bar.</p>

</div>


<p>When A-bra-ham Lin-coln was a score and five years
old, a great chance to step up came to him. His friends
sent him to the Il-li-nois Leg-is-la-ture. He had then
not one dol-lar with which he could buy clothes to wear
to that place. A friend let him have the funds of which
he was in need, sure that they would come back to him.</p>

<p>At first, the young man in the new place did not
talk or do much. He felt that it was best for him, then,
to wait and learn. He made a stud-y of the new sort
of men a-bout him at that time. When it came his turn
to speak, he said just what he thought on the theme
that came up. His mind told him that all who paid
tax-es or bore arms ought to have the right to vote.
He was not a-fraid to say that, though men of more
years and more fame than he took the oth-er side. He
was brave, but not rash. His speech was plain, but to
the point. He did not boast. He did not try to hide
the fact that he was poor. There were, some-times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
those who called them-selves “men,” who would point
at his plain clothes of “blue jeans” and laugh at them,
and try to get oth-ers to do the same. The great length
of bod-y, the toil-worn hands, the back-woods ways
made talk for foes, but Lin-coln bore these “flings”
well, and oft-en used them for jokes.</p>

<p>Though this high post had come to A-bra-ham Lin-coln
he did not feel too proud to do the “sim-ple deeds
of kind-ness” which he had
done all through his life. It
seems that one day he went
out with some law-mak-ers,
for a ride on the prai-ries.
He passed a place where
a pig was stuck in
the mud. The poor
beast looked up at
him as if beg-ging
his help. The look
plain-ly said that
death must soon
come un-less the
horse-man gave his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
aid. Lin-coln was wear-ing his best clothes at that time.
They had been bought with the mon-ey his friend had
loaned him. A new suit could not be his for a long
time. And yet, e-ven though gone past, and at the
risk of jeers from his com-rades, he went back, got off
his horse, and pulled the pig out up-on firm land. To
be sure there was mud on his clothes, but his heart was
free from re-gret.</p>

</div>

<p>Though A-bra-ham Lin-coln had been ad-mit-ted to
the Bar and had been made a mem-ber of the Leg-is-la-ture,
still he went on with his stud-ies, nev-er let-ting a
day go by on which he did not give some hours to
books. These books told a-bout math-e-mat-ics, as-tron-o-my,
rhet-o-ric, lit-er-a-ture, log-ic and oth-er things
with hard names.</p>

<p>While at work with chain and tools, tak-ing the length
and breadth of the land, Mr. Lin-coln earned from
$12.00 to $15.00 each month. He used a part of this
small sum to pay up an old debt and al-so had to help
his kin from week to week. But he felt he must give
up this small sure mon-ey for the sake of his new start
in life, though the gains were by no means sure to be
large. He said he would “take his chance” at the law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in A-pril, 1837, that Mr. Lin-coln rode in-to
Spring-field, Ill., on a horse a friend had loaned him.
A few clothes were all that he owned, and these he had
in a pair of sad-dle bags, strapped on his horse. He
drew up his steed in front of Josh-u-a Speed’s store and
went in.</p>

<p>“I want a room, and must have a bed-stead and some
bed-ding. How much shall I pay?” he asked.</p>

<p>His friend Speed took his slate and count-ed up the
price of these things. They came to $17.00.</p>

<p>“Well,” said A-bra-ham Lin-coln, “I’ve no doubt
but that is cheap but I’ve no mon-ey to pay for them.
If you can trust me till Christ-mas, and I earn an-y-thing
at law, I’ll pay you then. If I fail, I fear I shall nev-er
be a-ble to pay you.”</p>

<p>Lin-coln’s face was sad. He had worked hard all his
life, had helped scores of folks, and now, af-ter so man-y
years, when he much need-ed mon-ey, he had none.</p>

<p>The friend-ly store-keep-er tried to cheer the good
man. “I can fix things bet-ter than that,” he said. “I
have a large room and a dou-ble bed up stairs. You
are wel-come to share my room and bed with me.”</p>

<p>So A-bra-ham Lin-coln took his sad-dle-bags up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
stairs, and then came down with a bright look on his
face, and said, “There, I am moved!”</p>

<p>In Spring-field at that time was a man who had been
with Lin-coln as a sol-dier in the In-di-an war. This
was Ma-jor John T. Stu-art. He took Lin-coln in with
him as a law-part-ner and their firm name was Stu-art
&amp; Lin-coln.</p>

<p>A-bra-ham Lin-coln’s first fee was three dol-lars made
in Oc-to-ber, 1837. There was not much law work the
first sum-mer. What there was had to be paid for,
oft-en, in but-ter, milk, fruit, eggs, or dry goods.</p>

<p>In those days folks lived so far a-part, that courts
were held first in one place and then in an-oth-er. So
Lin-coln rode a-bout the land, to go with the courts and
pick up a case here and there. In this way he saw
lots of peo-ple, made warm friends, and told scores of
bright tales.</p>

<p>At no time did he use a word which was not clear
to the dull-est ju-ry-man. All things were made plain
when Lin-coln tried a case. Not on-ly was he plain and
straight in what he said and did, but his heart was ev-er
ten-der and true.</p>

<p>A sto-ry is told of a thing that took place on one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the “cir-cuit rid-ing” trips. Lin-coln saw two lit-tle birds
that the wind had blown from their nest, but where that
nest was one could not say. A close search at last
brought the nest to light, and Lin-coln took the birds
o-ver to it and placed them in it. His com-rades
laughed at him as he jumped on his horse and was rid-ing
a-way.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, boys,” said he. “But I couldn’t sleep
to-night un-less I had found the moth-er’s nest for those
birds.”</p>

<p>All ha-bits of stud-y were kept up, and in time fame
as a speak-er came to A-bra-ham Lin-coln. As a
wri-ter, too, he was prized. E-ven at the age of a score
and nine years he wrote so well up-on themes of the day
that the San-ga-mon Jour-nal and oth-er pa-pers would
print his ar-ti-cles in full.</p>

<p>In the year 1840, Miss Ma-ry Todd of Ken-tuc-ky
be-came Lin-coln’s wife, and helped him save his funds
so well that, in a short time he was a-ble to buy a small
house in Spring-field. Then, soon, he bought a horse
and he was ver-y glad to do so.</p>

<p>By that year so well did Lin-coln speak that his name
was put up-on the “Har-ri-son E-lec-to-ral Tick-et,” that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
he should “can-vass the State.” As he went a-bout the
land he oft-en met old friends, those who had known him
as a poor boy. Some-times it chanced that he could be
of use to them.</p>

<p>There was a Jack Arm-strong who once fought Lin-coln
when he was a clerk at Of-futt’s. The son of this
man was in trou-ble. The charge was mur-der. His
fa-ther be-ing dead, the moth-er, Han-nah, who knew
and had been kind to the boy Lin-coln, went, now, to
the man Lin-coln to plead with him to save her son.
The case was tak-en up, and much time and thought
giv-en to it. Things which were false had been told
but Lin-coln was a-ble to search out and find the truth,
and when at last he saw it and made oth-ers see it, the
lad went free.</p>

<p>Though, at first, A-bra-ham Lin-coln thought much
of An-drew Jack-son, as time went on he found that
Jack-son held views that he could not hold. So he
came to be known as an an-ti-Jack-son man and made
his first en-try in-to pub-lic life as such. At the age of
31 he was known as the a-blest Whig stump speak-er
in Il-li-nois. Two great Whigs at that time were
Dan-iel Web-ster and Hen-ry Clay. Lin-coln was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sent, as a Whig, in 1846, to the Con-gress of the
U-ni-ted States, and he was the sole Whig mem-ber
from Il-li-nois.</p>

<div class="caption">HENRY CLAY</div>
</div>

<p>Of course, friends were proud to feel that the poor
back-woods lad had come to so much fame. Some of
the old folks said they “knew it was in him.” Oth-ers
said “I told you so!”</p>

<p>Lin-coln had the same good sense that he had from
the start.</p>

<p>He made up his mind to watch and wait. He knew
that he could learn a deal from such great men as Web-ster
and Clay. When he had to speak he said just
what he thought in a plain strong way. He did not
want war with Mex-i-co. He was not a-lone in this.
But he thought that men who fought in that war, brave
sol-diers, should have their re-ward.</p>

<p>A thing that was of great weight Lin-coln did at that
time. He put in a bill which was to free the slaves in
the Dis-trict of Co-lum-bia. By his vote more than
once for the famed “Wil-mot Pro-vi-so” he hoped to
keep sla-ver-y from the Ter-ri-to-ries gained through the
war with Mex-i-co.</p>

<p>Though some fame came then to Lin-coln, funds did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
not. Spring-field, home, and law work fol-lowed when
the term in Con-gress was o-ver.</p>

<p>Those who took the oth-er side from Whigs were
called Dem-o-crats. They made a strong par-ty in
Il-li-nois, and were
led by a bright man
whose name was Ste-phen
A. Doug-las.
His friends called him
“the Lit-tle Gi-ant.”
This, they thought,
would make known to
all that though he was
small in size he was
great in mind. He
was well thought of
as a mem-ber of Con-gress,
could make a
good speech, was a fine law-yer, knew how to dress well,
and had a way of mak-ing folks think as he did.</p>

<p>While hard at work in law ca-ses, all at once, the
calm of Lin-coln’s life was bro-ken by a thing that took
place in 1854. A plan or pro-mise had been made that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
sla-ver-y should not spread north of the state of Mis-sou-ri.
When the new states of Kan-sas and Ne-bra-ska
were a-bout to be made, this good pro-mise was
thrown a-side and a
bill was passed by Con-gress
which said that
the folks who had their
homes in those states
might say that there
should or should not
be sla-ver-y there.</p>

<p>The man who put
in that bill was Ste-phen
A. Doug-las.
The bill roused great
rage in those who felt
that sla-ver-y had gone
quite far e-nough.</p>

<p>Most folks at the North felt that the time had come
to cry “halt.” All through the states this theme was
so much talked a-bout that two sides were made, one of
which was formed of those who were will-ing that
sla-ver-y should go on and spread, while the oth-er was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
formed of those who did not wish to have black men
held as slaves in the new lands.</p>

<p>Speech-es were made in great halls, and crowds
came to hear what the speak-ers had to say. In Il-li-nois,
Lin-coln, who all his life had been a-gainst sla-ver-y,
spoke straight to the peo-ple, show-ing them the wrong
or the “in-jus-tice” of that bill. His first speech on this
theme, has been called “one of the great speech-es of the
world.” He was brave and dared to say that “if
A-mer-i-ca were to be a free land, the stain of sla-ver-y,
must be wiped out.”</p>

<p>He said “A house di-vi-ded a-gainst it-self can-not
stand. I be-lieve this gov-ern-ment can-not en-dure
half slave and half free. I do not ex-pect the Un-ion to
be dis-solved; I do not ex-pect the house to fall; but I
ex-pect it will cease to be di-vi-ded. It will be-come all
one thing or all the oth-er. Ei-ther the op-po-nents of sla-ver-y
will ar-rest the fur-ther spread of it and place it
where the pub-lic mind shall rest in the be-lief that it is
in the course of ul-ti-mate ex-tinc-tion, or the ad-vo-cates
will push it for-ward till it shall be-come a-like law-ful
in all the states—old as well as new, North as well as
South.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>This speech made a great stir in the land. Some
men and wom-en had worked for years to do and say
the best thing for the slave but not one had put things
just right till Lin-coln said that “if A-mer-i-ca would
live it must be free.”</p>

<p>Lin-coln’s friends told him that they felt that his
speech would make foes for him and keep him from be-ing
sen-a-tor. The good man then said:</p>

<p>“Friends, this thing has been re-tard-ed long e-nough.
The time has come when those sen-ti-ments should be
ut-tered; and if it is de-creed that I should go down be-cause
of this speech, then let me go down linked to the
truth—let me die in the ad-vo-ca-cy of what is just and
right.”</p>

<p>From the first, Lin-coln felt as if he were in the
hands of God and led by Him in what he was to say
and do in the cause of Free-dom for all. He felt that
he, him-self, was not much, but that “Jus-tice and Truth”
would live though he might go down in their de-fence.</p>

<p>Though not quite half a cen-tu-ry had then gone by
since his dear moth-er had held him in her arms in their
poor Ken-tuc-ky home, and it was less, too, than a
score and five years since he swung his axe in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
woods on the banks of the San-ga-mon to earn his
bread and that of his kin from day to day, still, with the
great prize be-fore him of that high post in the land,
which he had long hoped to gain, he casts from him all
chan-ces for his fur-ther rise, and in that hour stands
forth one of the tru-est, no-blest men of all time.</p>

<p>Friends kept say-ing to Lin-coln “You’ve ruined
your chan-ces. You’ve made a mis-take. Aren’t you
sor-ry? Don’t you wish you hadn’t writ-ten that
speech?”</p>

<p>Straight came the an-swer, and it was this:</p>

<p>“If I had to draw a pen a-cross my whole life and
e-rase it from ex-ist-ence, and I had one poor lit-tle gift
or choice left as to what I should save from the wreck,
I should choose that speech and leave it to the world
as it is.”</p>

<p>Men then be-gan to think as they had nev-er thought
be-fore. It seemed as if a death-shot had been sent
straight to the heart of sla-ver-y. That speech was,
how-ev-er, but the first of a hard and fierce strug-gle
be-tween two sides of one of the great-est ques-tions
ev-er brought be-fore an-y na-tion.</p>

<p>Lin-coln and Doug-las went up and down the state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of Il-li-nois talk-ing in halls and in “wig-wams” as the
build-ings were called where they spoke. Some-times
they made a speech on the same day, out of doors,
where large crowds would come. Both oft-en held forth
in the same hall, one mak-ing his views known be-fore
din-ner and the oth-er talk-ing on the oth-er side af-ter
din-ner. Lin-coln was not known to make fun of an-y
one, but there were scores who made fun of him, and
tried to make him an-gry. But he an-swered all their
scoff with sound state-ments, and found friends where
oth-ers would have made foes. Doug-las had a way of
tell-ing folks that Lin-coln said some things which he
did not say. This was hard to bear, but Lin-coln would
tell the crowds just what he did say at such and such a
meet-ing and peo-ple would be-lieve him.</p>

<p>Lin-coln’s print-ed speech-es went through all the
states, and soon folks out-side of his own state had a
wish to hear him. They felt that he was at the head of
the par-ty for real lib-er-ty. So the time came when
A-bra-ham Lin-coln spoke East and West, in Il-li-nois,
O-hi-o, Con-nect-i-cut, New Hamp-shire, Rhode Is-land,
Kan-sas, and New York, and crowds would be still
while he pled the cause of lib-er-ty and struck blows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
at sla-ver-y. It is said that when he spoke in New
York he ap-peared, in ev-er-y sense of the word, like
one of the plain folks a-mong whom he loved to be
count-ed. At first sight one could not see an-y-thing
great in him save his great size, which would strike one
e-ven in a crowd; his clothes hung in a loose way on
his gi-ant frame, his face was dark and had no tinge of
col-or. His face was full of seams and bore marks of
his long days of hard toil; his eyes were deep-set and
had a look of sad-ness in them. At first he did not
seem at ease. The folks who were in that place to hear
him were men and wom-en of note as well as those not
so well known. There was a sea of ea-ger fa-ces to
greet him and to find out what that rude child of the
peo-ple was like. All soon formed great i-de-as of him,
and these held to the end of his talk. He met with
praise on all sides. He rose to his best when he saw
what the folks thought of him. He spoke in his best
vein. His eyes shone bright, his voice rang, his face
seemed to light up the whole place. For an hour and
a half he held sway in that hall and spoke straight to
the point, clos-ing with these words,</p>

<p>“Let us have faith that right makes might, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
that faith let us, to the end, dare to do our du-ty as we
un-der-stand it.”</p>

<p>A tale is told of Lin-coln’s go-ing with a friend, while
in New York, to vis-it a Sun-day School at Five Points,
a place where waifs were brought each Sab-bath to
meet kind men and wom-en whose wish was to help
them.</p>

<p>As the good man saw the poor chil-dren from the
slums of the cit-y, his ten-der heart was deep-ly touched.
His own poor child-hood came up be-fore him, and when
urged to speak he said words which brought tears to all
eyes. He told them that he, too, had been poor; that
his toes stuck out through worn shoes in win-ter, that
his arms were out at the el-bows and he shiv-ered with
the cold. He said he had found that there was on-ly
one rule—“al-ways do the best you can.” He said he
had al-ways tried to do the best he could, and that if
they would fol-low that rule that they “would get on
some-how.” When he felt that he had talked long
e-nough and tried to bring his words to a close, there
were cries of “Go on!” “Do go on!” and so he told his
young hear-ers man-y things that they were glad to hear.
Then they sang some of their songs for him, and one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
these moved him to tears. He asked for the book
where those words were print-ed, and a cop-y hav-ing
been giv-en to him he put the lit-tle hym-nal in-to his
pock-et, and man-y a time in af-ter days drew it out to
read.</p>

<p>At last, as he was leav-ing the school, one teach-er,
who had not caught his name, when the head of the
Mis-sion, Mr. Pease, gave it out, went up to him as he
passed and asked what it was. The great man said, in
low and qui-et tones, “A-bra-ham Lin-coln, from
Il-li-nois.”</p>

<small>LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS.</small></h2>

<p>Though Lin-coln lost his e-lec-tion as Sen-a-tor he did
not seem to care. Doug-las was the choice, and Lin-coln
went back to Spring-field and took up his law work.
This, too, all turned out well for Lin-coln and the cause
he loved, for had he been e-lect-ed Sen-a-tor he might
not have tak-en just the part he did in the work of help-ing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to form the Re-pub-li-can par-ty. While Lin-coln
then gave much work to the Law, he felt the stress of
the times so much, and knew the great need of help-ing
the side of the right just then, that he did not go out of
pol-i-tics. He took an ac-tive in-ter-est in ev-er-y cam-paign
and wrote much to aid the cause.</p>

<p>It was in the cold months of 1855 that he went to a
meet-ing of Free-soil ed-i-tors at De-ca-tur, Ill., and
then and there a move was made to help on the new
par-ty which was to do its best to stop sla-ver-y from
spread-ing. He worked ear-ly and late for the good of
this par-ty try-ing to make men of un-like views a-gree.
He said his wish was “to hedge a-gainst di-vis-ions,”
and keep all straight to the point of hold-ing back the
spread of sla-ver-y.</p>

<p>Work as hard as he might for this great cause there
were thou-sands who did not think as Lin-coln did.
They said he was wrong and should they fol-low him
the land would be in ru-ins and the Un-ion at an end.
But all this could not stop this good man, for he knew
that he spoke the truth, so threats, a-buse, and sneers
could not stir him from his grand work.</p>

<p>Be-fore this, in Ju-ly 1854, moves be-gan in man-y<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
parts of the North to form a new par-ty which should
be a-gainst the spread of sla-ver-y. So in June, 1856,
most of the States sent del-e-gates to Phil-a-del-phi-a
and then and there the Re-pub-li-can par-ty was formed.
They chose John C. Fre-mont as their can-di-date for
the Pres-i-den-cy. Fre-mont was known as a brave ex-plor-er
in the plains of the West, and one who took part
in the con-quest of Cal-i-for-ni-a.</p>

<p>There was, al-so, a par-ty called “The A-mer-i-can,”
or “Know-noth-ing” and they named as their choice,
ex-Pres-i-dent Mil-lard Fill-more. This par-ty grew fast
two or three years and then came to an end. Its aim
was to keep men from o’er the sea out of of-fice and
make them wait more time ere they could vote. The
theme of sla-ver-y then came to have a new form and
there was no room for oth-er de-bate.</p>

<p>The Dem-o-crat-ic par-ty met in Cin-cin-na-ti and
named James Bu-chan-an of Penn-syl-va-ni-a as their
choice. Bu-chan-an was e-lec-ted.</p>

<p>Ste-phen A. Doug-las thought he was sure of a nom-i-na-tion
for that same place. He had done much work
for the men who held slaves but they did not mean to
re-ward him for what he had done.</p>

<p>“Shall Kan-sas come in free or not?” was the ques-tion
that, then, was up-on the minds of thou-sands up-on
thou-sands of the peo-ple of the U-ni-ted States.</p>

<p>A-bra-ham Lin-coln,
then, think-ing of
the mil-lions of his
fel-low-men in sla-ver-y
and of that slave-mar-ket
in New Or-leans,
which had nev-er gone
out of his mind, spoke,
both in pub-lic and
pri-vate, with the force
that e-ven he had
ne’er used be-fore. He
felt God’s time was
near at hand when
those who had been
bought and sold like beasts of the field, should be set
free. He did not then see just how it would be done,
but he said to a friend;</p>

<p>“Some-times when I am speak-ing I feel that the
time is soon com-ing when the sun shall shine and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
rain fall on no man who shall go forth to un-re-quit-ed
toil. How it will come, I can-not tell; but that time
will sure-ly come!”</p>

<p>It was in March 1857, when Bu-chan-an had his in-au-gu-ral
ad-dress all writ-ten out with care, and he was
read-y to take his seat as Chief in the land, that he was
told that a great step was a-bout to be tak-en by the “Su-preme
Court,” the high-est court of law in the land. It
seems that the jud-ges were then to de-cide in a case
which dealt with the rights of men who held slaves un-der
the Con-sti-tu-tion.</p>

<p>Mr. Bu-chan-an thought it would be well to put a few
words more in-to his ad-dress, and these up-on the theme
then brought up to him. So he wrote that he hoped
the steps that were to be tak-en would “for-ev-er set-tle
that vex-a-tious slave ques-tion.”</p>

<p>In a few days Rog-er B. Ta-ney of Ma-ry-land,
Chief Jus-tice, gave the peo-ple of the U-ni-ted States a
great sur-prise in what he had to say a-bout two slaves.</p>

<p>A sur-geon in the ar-my, Dr. Em-er-son, of St. Lou-is,
owned Dred Scott and his wife Har-ri-et. He took
them to Rock Is-land, in I-o-wa, to Fort Snell-ing, Min-ne-so-ta,
and then back to St. Lou-is. As they had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
tak-en in-to a Free Ter-ri-to-ry the slaves made a
claim that they were en-ti-tled to their lib-er-ty un-der
the com-mon law of the coun-try. Five of the nine
jud-ges of that court were from the Slave States. Sev-en
of the jud-ges were of the same mind that the Con-sti-tu-tion
“re-cog-nized slaves as prop-er-ty and noth-ing
more.” The jud-ges held that as the blacks were not and
nev-er could be cit-i-zens, they could not bring a suit in
an-y court of the U-ni-ted States. The claim of Dred
and Har-ri-et Scott would have to be set-tled by the
Court of Mis-sou-ri. It was de-cid-ed that some laws
made in 1820 and 1850 which could have helped the
case of these two poor blacks, were “un-con-sti-tu-tion-al,”
not le-gal or so as to a-gree with the law. They
said all this showed, plain-ly, that a slave had no more
rights than a cow or pig, and that be-ing the case sla-ver-y
could not on-ly be in the Ter-ri-tor-ies, but just as
well in the Free States. This sort of be-lief up-set the
i-de-as that Mr. Doug-las taught, for he had told all to
whom he made his great speech-es that on-ly those who
lived in a Ter-ri-to-ry had a right to say wheth-er they
would or would not have sla-ver-y.</p>

<p>Out of all these nine jud-ges there were but two who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
were brave, wise, and just e-nough to hold to the point
that it was up-on free-dom and not up-on sla-ver-y that
the na-tion had been found-ed. The names of those two
men were Mr. Cur-tis of Mas-sa-chu-setts, and Mr.
Mc-Lean of O-hi-o.</p>

<p>The peo-ple rose in great wrath at what the sev-en
jud-ges had said. With the blood of free-dom in their
veins they plain-ly stat-ed that those un-just jud-ges had
“de-cid-ed” what they did in the in-ter-ests of sla-ver-y.</p>

<p>The eyes of thou-sands of peo-ple o-pened. They
saw now that there was much hard work to be done if
there were to be a “Free Kan-sas,” and so they gave
their votes and la-bor on the “free” side. Then when
the slave-hold-ers felt there were more folks who want-ed
Kan-sas free, they sent men from oth-er states in-to
Kan-sas and this got in vast num-bers of votes that had
no right to be put in-to the bal-lot-box-es.</p>

<p>The two sets had con-ven-tions, the Free States at
To-pe-ka and the slave-hold-ers at Le-comp-ton. The
pa-pers drawn up in these two pla-ces were sent to
Wash-ing-ton. In the cit-y there were men who did
their best to get Bu-chan-an to try to have Kan-sas
made a state where there could be slaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Then it was that Ste-phen A. Doug-las went to see
Pres-i-dent Bu-chan-an and have a talk with him. Doug-las
was an-gry at what the un-just jud-ges said. The
Pres-i-dent said that he, him-self, was in fa-vor of the
Le-comp-ton pa-per, that for slaves in Kan-sas. Then
Doug-las told him that he should work a-gainst the
views there held, and Bu-chan-an told him that a Dem-o-crat
could not have i-de-as that would dif-fer from
those held by the pres-i-dent and lead-ers of his own
par-ty, with-out be-ing crushed by them. So Doug-las
went a-way. He knew the slave pow-er would not
for-give him for the stand he took, but he al-so knew
that if he did not work a-gainst hav-ing slaves in Kan-sas
he would lose his own re-e-lec-tion to the Se-nate.</p>

<p>So a new al-ly a-gainst the spir-it of sla-ver-y was
gained, though Doug-las did not work in the same har-ness
as those who had formed the new par-ty of which
we have spok-en—the Re-pub-li-can.</p>

<small>THE PEOPLE ASK LINCOLN TO BE THEIR PRESIDENT.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>All this time A-bra-ham Lin-coln was go-ing on do-ing
his work in law and help-ing as much as he could to
fix in the minds of the peo-ple right i-de-as for the gui-dance
of the na-tion.</p>

<p>Those who could un-der-stand the true needs of the
hour, and saw how strong they were, felt that if they
could place this man, who had ris-en up in the land to
lead the for-ces to lib-er-ty, in a post where he could
have full sway and do his best, they must name him for
just that work, so, when the “Na-tion-al Re-pub-li-can
Con-ven-tion” met at Chi-ca-go, May 16th, 1860, to
pro-pose some one for their Chief, they named A-bra-ham
Lin-coln, and said he was the man whom they
want-ed to be the next Pres-i-dent of the U-ni-ted
States.</p>

<p>Not on-ly was this a great thing for Lin-coln, but it
was, al-so, a bless-ed tri-umph for the A-mer-i-can peo-ple.
There were three oth-er men whose names were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
put up for the same post. These three men and their
friends thought it a most un-wise act to name Lin-coln.
But as time went on it was found that the e-lec-tion of
A-bra-ham Lin-coln was the best thing that ev-er came
to the coun-try.</p>

<p>At first, when Mr. Pick-ett, an ed-i-tor in Il-li-nois,
wrote to Lin-coln, in A-pril, 1859, that he and his part-ner
were off talk-ing to the Re-pub-li-can ed-i-tors of the
state on the theme of hav-ing Lin-coln’s name come out
at the same mo-ment from each pa-per, as a can-di-date
for the Pres-i-den-cy, Lin-coln wrote to him in re-ply:</p>

<p>“I must, in truth, say that I do not think my-self fit
for the Pres-i-den-cy.” Then he went on to say that he
thanked his friends for their trust in him, but thought it
would be best for the cause not to have such a step by
all at the same time.</p>

<p>But some of Il-li-nois’ best men took the mat-ter se-ri-ous-ly
in hand, and, at last, Lin-coln said they might
“use his name.” Then his friends went to work, and
in con-ven-tion it was found that A-bra-ham Lin-coln
had not on-ly the whole vote of Il-li-nois to start with,
but won votes on all sides, and did not make a foe of
an-y ri-val.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The Dem-o-crat-ic par-ty had split in two on the slave
theme. The ma-jor-i-ty of the Dem-o-crats who met at
Bal-ti-more named Ste-phen A. Doug-las of Il-li-nois,
the au-thor of the Kan-sas-Ne-bras-ka bill. Those Dem-o-crats
who stuck close to the South put for-ward John
C. Breck-in-ridge of Ken-tuc-ky. The “Con-sti-tu-tion-al
Un-ion” par-ty, as it was called, which wished to make
peace be-tween the an-gry sec-tions, named Bell of
Ten-nes-see.</p>

<p>The Re-pub-li-cans were u-ni-ted and ea-ger. The
e-lec-tion came on Nov. 6, 1860, and the re-sult was just
what most thought it would be. The Re-pub-li-can
e-lec-tors did not get a “ma-jor-i-ty,” of all the votes by
near-ly a mil-lion, but the split of the Dem-o-crats left
them a “plu-ral-i-ty.”</p>

<p>In the “E-lec-to-ral” col-le-ges A-bra-ham Lin-coln
got a plu-ral-i-ty of 57 votes and so was the choice for
Pres-i-dent of the U-ni-ted States.</p>

<p>A great crowd surged through the streets of Chi-ca-go
at the time when the con-ven-tion nom-i-na-ted Lin-coln.
Cheers rent the air, while can-non roared and
bon-fires blazed. Then the men who had tak-en part
in the work turned their steps home-ward.</p>

<p>The next morn-ing a pas-sen-ger car drawn by the
fast-est en-gine of the “Il-li-nois Cen-tral Rail-road”
rolled out from Chi-ca-go, and took some gen-tle-men
straight to Spring-field to tell Mr. Lin-coln of his nom-i-na-tion,
though, of course, the news had been sent there
by wire the night be-fore.</p>

<p>It was eight o’clock in the morn-ing when the par-ty
reached the Lin-coln home. The two sons, Wil-lie and
Thom-as, or “Tad” as he was called, were sit-ting on the
fence, laugh-ing with some boy friends. Tad stood up
and shout-ed “Hoo-ray!” in wel-come to the com-mit-tee.
A brief ad-dress was giv-en by the lead-er, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
short re-ply came from Lin-coln. Then they all went
in-to the li-bra-ry and met Mrs. Lin-coln, and a light
lunch was served. It was thought, by some, that Lin-coln
would set wines be-fore his guests at this time, but
he thought this thing one that was not best for folks, and
did not do it. He had learned a sad les-son from what
he saw of this sort in his young days.</p>

<p>Folks far and near then came to tell Mr. Lin-coln
that they were glad of the good news.</p>

<p>One good wom-an with but-ter and eggs to sell from
her farm, said she thought she “would like to shake
hands with Mr. Lin-coln once more.” Then she told
him, as he did not seem to re-mem-ber her, that he had
stopped at her house to get some-thing to eat when he
was ‘rid-ing the cir-cuit,’ and that one day he came
when she had noth-ing but bread and milk to give him,
and he said that it was good e-nough for the Pres-i-dent
of the U-ni-ted States, “and now,” she said, “I’m glad
that you are go-ing to be Pres-i-dent!”</p>

<p>An-oth-er guest came one day when Lin-coln was
talk-ing with the Gov-ern-or of his state and a few more.
The door o-pened and an old la-dy in a big sun bon-net
and farm clothes walked in and told Mr. Lin-coln<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
that she had a pres-ent for him. She said she had been
want-ing to give him some-thing, and these were all she
had. Then, with much pride, she put in-to his hands a
pair of blue wool-len stock-ings, and said, “I spun the
yarn and knit them socks my-self!”</p>

<p>The kind gift and thought pleased Mr. Lin-coln. He
thanked her, asked for her folks at home, and walked
with her to the door. When he came back he took up
the socks and held them by their toes, one in each hand,
while a queer smile came to his face and he said to his
guest,—</p>

<p>“The old la-dy got my lat-i-tude and long-i-tude
a-bout right, did-n’t she?”</p>

<p>The “plain peo-ple,” the sort from whom Lin-coln
sprung, were ver-y proud of him, and day af-ter day some
of them went to see him, bring-ing small gifts and
kind words and wish-es.</p>

<p>One day, when Mr. Lin-coln, clad in a lin-en dus-ter,
sat at the desk in his of-fice with a pile of let-ters and
an ink-stand of wood be-fore him, he saw two shy
young men peep in at the door. He spoke to them
in a kind way and asked them to come in and make a
call.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The farm hands thanked him and went in. Then
they said that one of them, whose name was Jim, was
quite tall. They had told him that he was as tall as the
great A-bra-ham Lin-coln, and they had made up their
minds to come to town and see if they could find out if
that was the case.</p>

<p>So with a smile on his face Mr. Lin-coln left his
desk, and the morn-ing’s mail, and asked the young man
to stand up by the side of the wall. Then Mr. Lin-coln
put a cane on the top of his head, and let the end
of the stick touch the plas-ter-ing. Thus he found his
height. Mr. Lin-coln told the man that it was now his
turn to hold the cane and do the same for him. So
Mr. Lin-coln stepped un-der the cane, and it was found
that both were the same height. Jim’s friends had made
a good guess.</p>

<p>Small deeds of kind-ness like these won hosts of
friends for A-bra-ham.</p>

<p>As time went on the trains brought scores of folks to
Spring-field. Some said they had just come to shake
hands with Mr. Lin-coln, while more told a straight tale
and said they came to ask for a post of some sort, and
thought they would “take time by the fore-lock.” In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
fact the crowds of men who came to ask for pri-zes were
so large that Mr. Lin-coln had to leave his old desk
and go to a room in the State-house which the Gov-ern-or
of Il-li-nois had placed at his use. Here he met all
in his kind way.</p>

<p>While Lin-coln wait-ed, af-ter his nom-i-na-tion, he
kept track of all the moves that were made. Still, he
had so much trust that he said, “The peo-ple of the
South have too much sense to ru-in the gov-ern-ment,”
and he told his friends that they must not say or feel
an-y ill will to those who were not of the same mind,
but “re-mem-ber that all A-mer-i-cans are broth-ers and
should live like broth-ers.”</p>

<p>But, ere long, it was plain that the storm which had
been mak-ing its way slow-ly but sure-ly, was a-bout to
burst.</p>

<p>As soon as Lin-coln’s e-lec-tion was known the South
be-gan to throw off the ties which bound it to the
Un-ion.</p>

<p>The Sen-a-tors from South Car-o-li-na gave up their
posts four days lat-er. Six weeks from that time that
state went out from the Un-ion and set up a new
gov-ern-ment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>One af-ter an-oth-er, oth-er states in the South went
out, al-so, and joined South Car-o-li-na, un-til, by the
first of Feb-ru-a-ry, 1861, all the sev-en cot-ton states had
with-drawn from the Un-ion. Their claim was that the
rights of a state were high-er than those of the Un-ion
when it thought it ought to do so.</p>

<p>Mem-bers of
Con-gress and oth-ers
tried to set-tle
the trou-ble but to
no a-vail, and
there seemed no
way a-head but a
tri-al of the is-sue
on the bat-tle-field.</p>

<p>Lin-coln was in
Spring-field and
could do naught then, save with his pen and words of
ad-vice to Bu-chan-an who was then Pres-i-dent. With
great sad-ness he read what had been done at the South.</p>

<div class="caption">THE LINCOLN HOME IN SPRINGFIELD.</div>
</div>

<p>There was still much to do in Spring-field in his
plans to leave his law work, and Mr. Lin-coln felt that
a great load of care was up-on him, and the task, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
in a few brief months would be his, was sure to be more
e-ven than that which fell to the first great Chief, George
Wash-ing-ton. There were times when he spent whole
days in deep thought, si-lent and sad.</p>

<p>Still, in the midst of all this work, there came times
when in a light-er vein he would show mirth at in-ci-dents
as they came up. A bus-i-ness trip had to be
made. A group of small girls was met at the house of
a friend. They gazed at the great man as if they would
speak to him. He kind-ly asked them if he could help
them in an-y way. One of them said that she would
dear-ly like to have him write his name for her.</p>

<p>Lin-coln said he saw oth-er young girls there and
thought that if he wrote his name for but one, the rest
would “feel bad-ly.”</p>

<p>The child then told him there were “eight all told.”
Then, with one of his bright smiles the kind man asked
for eight slips of pa-per and pen and ink. He wrote
his name so that each child might have it to take home
with her.</p>

<p>There was a lit-tle girl, that same au-tumn, whose
home was on the shores of Lake E-rie. She had a
por-trait of Lin-coln and a pic-ture of the log-cab-in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
which he helped build for his fa-ther in 1830. She had
great pride in Mr. Lin-coln, and it was her wish that he
should look as well as he could. So she asked her
moth-er if she might write a note to Mr. Lin-coln and
ask him if he would let his beard grow, for she thought
this would make his face more pleas-ing.</p>

<p>The moth-er thought this plan of her child was strange,
but know-ing that she was a strong Re-pub-li-can, said
there could be no harm in writ-ing such a let-ter. So
the let-ter was writ-ten and sent to “Hon. A-bra-ham
Lin-coln, Esq., Spring-field, Il-li-nois.”</p>

<p>This young girl, whose name was Grace Be-dell,
told Mr. Lin-coln how old she was, and that she thought
he would look bet-ter, and so that scores more folks
would like him, if he “would let his whis-kers grow.”
She said, too, that she liked the “rail fence, in the pic-ture,
a-round that cab-in that he helped his fa-ther
make.” Then she asked that if he were too bus-y to
an-swer her let-ter that he would let his own lit-tle girl
re-ply for him.</p>

<p>Mr. Lin-coln was in his State-house room when that
let-ter, with scores of oth-ers, came in. He could but
smile at the child’s wish, but he took the time to an-swer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
at once, in a brief note which be-gan, “Miss Grace
Be-dell: My dear lit-tle Miss.” He told her of the
re-ceipt of her “ver-y a-gree-a-ble let-ter.” He said he
was “sor-ry to say that he had no lit-tle daugh-ter,”
but that he “had three sons, one sev-en-teen, one nine,
and one sev-en years of age.” He said he had nev-er
worn whis-kers, and asked if folks would not think it
sil-ly to be-gin, then, to wear them. The note closed
with; “Your ver-y sin-cere well-wish-er, A. Lin-coln.”</p>

<small>IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CHAIR; THE CIVIL WAR BEGINS.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>One of the last things that A-bra-ham Lin-coln did ere
he said good-bye to his Spring-field home was to go
down to see the good old step-moth-er who did so
much for him when he was a poor, sad boy. Proud in-deed,
was she of the lad she had reared with so much
care, but she felt that there were hard days to come to
him. She told him that she feared she should not see
him a-gain. She said “They will kill you; I know
they will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Lin-coln tried to cheer her, and told her they would
not do that. But she clung to him with tears, and a
break-ing heart. “We must trust in the Lord, and
all will be well,” said the good man as he bade his step-moth-er
a ten-der fare-well and went a-way.</p>

<p>It was on Feb. 11, 1861, that Lin-coln left Spring-field
for Wash-ing-ton. Snow was fall-ing fast as Lin-coln
stood at the rear of his train to say his last words.
A great crowd was at the rail-road sta-tion. Men
stood si-lent with bare heads while he spoke.</p>

<p>Six firm friends of Mr. Lin-coln went with him to
Wash-ing-ton. Mr. Lin-coln was ver-y much af-fect-ed
when he went in-to the car af-ter say-ing good-bye to
his old home folks. Tears were in his eyes.</p>

<p>Crowds were at each sta-tion a-long the route and
Mr. Lin-coln oft-en spoke to those who had come there
to see him. While talk-ing at West-field Mr. Lin-coln
said that he had a young friend there who had sent a
note to him, and that if Grace Be-dell were in the sta-tion
he should like to meet the child. It seems she was
there, and the word was passed on; “Grace, Grace,
the Pres-i-dent is call-ing for you!” A friend led her
through the crowd, and Mr. Lin-coln took her by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
hand and kissed her. Then he said, with a smile,
“You see, Grace, that I have let my whis-kers grow!”</p>

<p>The train then rushed off, but a smile was on Mr.
Lin-coln’s face, and for a brief time the weight of of-fice
had left him.</p>

<p>Threats of a sad sort were then a-broad in the land.
Foes said Lin-coln should nev-er be made Pres-i-dent.
Their hearts were full of hate. They felt that this man
would be sure to en-force the laws, e-ven a-gainst those
who were joined to-geth-er to try to break them.</p>

<p>Lin-coln was brave. He did not fear. He felt that
the Lord was on his side and that He would give him
strength to do all the work that he had planned for
him. Though he did not doubt this, yet, both he and
his friends felt that it would not be right to risk his life
at that time, so they did not take the route at first
thought of, but went by a way, and at a time, which
would make all safe.</p>

<p>Thus the train from Phil-a-del-phi-a rolled in-to Wash-ing-ton
ear-ly one morn-ing and Lin-coln was safe, and
must, in-deed, have felt the truth of those Bi-ble words,
“He shall give His an-gels charge o-ver thee to keep
thee in all thy ways.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>On the Fourth of March, 1861, A-bra-ham Lin-coln
stood on a plat-form, built for that day, on the east
front of the cap-i-tol, and took the oath of of-fice. He
laid his right hand on the Bi-ble. A hush fell up-on
the vast throng as he said, af-ter Chief Jus-tice Ta-ney,
these words: “I, A-bra-ham Lin-coln, do sol-emn-ly
swear that I will faith-ful-ly ex-e-cute the of-fice of
Pres-i-dent of the U-ni-ted States, and will, to the
best of my a-bil-i-ty, pre-serve, pro-tect, and de-fend
the Con-sti-tu-tion of the U-ni-ted States.”</p>

<p>Then came the can-non sa-lute while cheer on cheer
rent the air.</p>

<p>Lin-coln read his in-au-gu-ral ad-dress as Pres-i-dent
of the U-ni-ted States. His old ri-val, Doug-las was
near him, and to show his friend-ly and loy-al heart,
held Lin-coln’s hat.</p>

<p>Lin-coln’s speech was a grand one. He did not
boast nor tell what great things he would do. He
spoke as would a fa-ther to way-ward chil-dren, and
told those who were try-ing to break up the Un-ion
that their move would bring ru-in to the Na-tion. He
asked them to stop, and turn back while there was time.</p>

<p>In sad-ness he told them that it was not right for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
an-y to try to des-troy the Un-ion; that it was his
sworn du-ty to pre-serve it. This speech did much
good, but most-ly where there were folks who had not
known which side to take. These saw, then, that the
Pres-i-dent was bound by his oath to do his dut-y.</p>

<p>No Chief of the U-ni-ted States, when he took his
chair, had so hard a task be-fore him as Lin-coln had.
Sev-en States had gone out of the Un-ion, made a start
at a new gov-ern-ment, and found a pres-i-dent and a
vice-pres-i-dent for them-selves. Some of the folks in
oth-er states were mak-ing plans to leave the Un-ion.
The peo-ple of the far South laid hold of Un-ion forts,
ships, guns, and post-of-fi-ces. Some men who had
held high posts in the ar-my and na-vy left the Un-ion
and gave their help to the oth-er side. They had sent
out the news to the world that they would have the
name of the “Con-fed-er-ate States of A-mer-i-ca,” and
that their pres-i-dent’s name was Jef-fer-son Dav-is.</p>

<p>How to save the Un-ion, bring back all the states,
make the North and South friends once more were
themes of the day. These thoughts hung like a weight
o-ver Lin-coln as he paced his room at night, and as he
talked with the men he had with him. He did not wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to de-clare war. He must, he thought, work for peace.
This he did till he saw war must come, but he made up
his mind that the first act that brought a-bout war
should not come from
him but from those
whose wish was to
break up the Un-ion.
At last the foe struck
the first blow.</p>

<p>It was on a spring
day, the twelfth of
A-pril, 1861, that the
first gun was fired in
Charles-ton har-bor
up-on the Un-ion flag
on Fort Sum-ter.
The call was sound-ed.
The great heart
of the North grew hot with shame and rage.</p>

<p>“What! De-grade our coun-try’s flag?” they cried.
“’Tis the flag for which our fa-thers fought and died!”
“We will give the last drop of our blood for it! We
will leave our trades, our homes and dear ones, and fly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to put down the foe who has dared to strike a blow
at it!”</p>

<p>But in Charles-ton, S. C. the folks were wild with
joy. The Gov-ern-or of the state, Pick-ens, made a
speech from the bal-co-ny of a ho-tel. He said, “Thank
God, the day has come! The war is o-pen, and we
will con-quer or pe-rish. We have de-feat-ed twen-ty
mil-lions, and we have hum-bled their proud flag of
stars and stripes.” There was much more talk in the
same vein.</p>

<p>In the North men wept who ne’er had wept be-fore.
It seemed as if the worst had come. “But Lin-coln,
our brave Lin-coln, what will he do now?” they asked.
A-bra-ham Lin-coln knew just what to do. He did not
need to be told. He knew that the peo-ple would de-cide
the mat-ter and to them he turned. He talked
with his men near him, his “Cab-i-net,” and said that
75,000 of “the peo-ple” would come to his aid and
quell this thing. Four times that num-ber came.</p>

<p>The par-ties, “Re-pub-li-can” and “Dem-o-crat,” for
the time were both much of one mind, “For the Un-ion,”
side by side to “fall in” and march south and save it.</p>

<p>One state had troops all read-y to start. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Mas-sa-chu-setts. Her Gov-ern-or, in 1860, N. P.
Banks, had long seen the trend of things, the need of
men that must come, so his sol-diers were a-ble to leave
at the first call for help. On A-pril 19, the Sixth Reg-i-ment
fought its way through the streets of Bal-ti-more,
and reached Wash-ing-ton in time to aid Lin-coln in
hold-ing the cap-i-tol.</p>

<p>In ev-er-y cit-y and town there were drum beats and
the cry of “To arms! To arms!” Men were in haste
to give their help to the great Chief, A-bra-ham Lin-coln,
whose call they had heard.</p>

<p>Ste-phen A. Doug-las, now that the ver-y life of the
Un-ion was at stake, left no doubt as to where he stood.
He made it plain-ly known that he was “For the
Un-ion,” and he led the loy-al Dem-o-crats of the North
to up-hold the Un-ion, and they went glad-ly with him
to the task.</p>

<p>Much as the men who led the South to try to go out
of the Un-ion were to blame, it was well known that
man-y in the South were loath to go and did so on-ly
when their states said they must.</p>

<p>Some of the best gen-er-als on the side of the South,
such as Lee, were of those un-will-ing men. Each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
them fought the North be-cause his own state told him
to. The bad “doc-trine of State Rights,” brought this
a-bout. Un-der it the state was held to have a claim
up-on those who lived in it high-er than the claim which
the na-tion had up-on them.</p>

<p>The men who stood for the cause of the South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
burned the bridg-es on the rail-roads lead-ing north
from Bal-ti-more so that no more troops might reach
Wash-ing-ton from that side.</p>

<p>Cit-i-zens, un-der the com-mand of Maj-or Da-vid
Hun-ter, kept guard o-ver the White House and
Treas-u-ry.</p>

</div>

<p>All through the long, sad hours Pres-i-dent Lin-coln
stood at the helm and was the pi-lot who, un-der the
Lord, took the Ship of State through the most aw-ful
storm in which she had ev-er sailed.</p>

<p>It was, in-deed, a glad hour when the 8th Mas-sa-chu-setts
reg-i-ment and the 7th New York reached
Wash-ing-ton. This made the Cap-i-tol safe.</p>

<p>In the West, at Il-li-nois, troops from Chi-ca-go took
pos-ses-sion of Cai-ro.</p>

<p>So, by the prompt com-ing of troops to Wash-ing-ton
and of those troops in the West keep-ing charge at
Cai-ro, the plans of the South-ern foe were checked.</p>

<small>EARLY BATTLES OF THE WAR.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The foe moved their cap-i-tal from Mont-gom-er-y, Ala.
to Rich-mond, Va. and the first bat-tle of weight was to
lie be-tween the two cap-i-tals. The folks at the North
thought the war would be a short one. Most of the
North-ern vol-un-teers had been called out for but three
months, so it was thought by some that a bat-tle must
be fought ere that time came to an end. The press at
the North made a loud call for a “for-ward move-ment.”
From day to day there was the cry of “On to
Rich-mond!”</p>

<p>This hot speed was not the wish of Gen. Scott, then
Com-man-der-in-chief of all the U. S. troops. He said
it would be “death to our cause.” It has since been
thought that if the men in the North had been more
slow to move, the first great loss would not have been
theirs.</p>

<p>It was on the 21st, of Ju-ly, 1861, that the bat-tle of
Bull Run was fought. Gen-er-al Mc-Do-well moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to-wards Rich-mond. The foe was led by Gens.
Jo-seph E. John-ston and Beau-re-gard. The bat-tle
was a sharp one and the loss large. At just the right
mo-ment the foe had fresh troops sent to help them and
thus gained the day. Af-ter a hard fight, the Un-ion
for-ces had to give up. They fled back in haste to
Wash-ing-ton.</p>

<div class="caption">MARCHING TO BULL RUN.</div>
</div>

<p>Sher-man was Colo-nel of a reg-i-ment at Bull Run.
Though he did his part well, he had a fear that the
Pres-i-dent would find fault with him for the great loss
at that bat-tle. He felt that he had done all he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
with men who had been rushed in-to a fight ere they
had had time to learn the art of war. Lin-coln knew
that Sher-man had done his best with what he had.
He knew that Sher-man was “val-u-a-ble man,” so he
at once made him a Brig-a-dier Gen-er-al, sent him to
Lou-is-ville, Ken-tuc-ky, and put him in charge of a
large force of troops.</p>

<p>The bat-tle of Bull Run, it has been said, was fought
to please “the pol-i-ti-cians.” It was the on-ly time the
Pres-i-dent yield-ed to the pub-lic clam-or, and he was
al-ways sor-ry that he then did so.</p>

<p>In a few days af-ter the bat-tle of Bull Run the Pres-i-dent
went out to see the sol-diers. He made a kind
speech, and told them to “cheer up,” for he “knew that
bet-ter days were com-ing.”</p>

<p>Pres-i-dent Lin-coln felt that while Gen. Scott had a
ver-y sound head and had done great good in his long
years of work in the ar-my, he had come to the time
when age had be-gun to “tell” up-on him. But what
man could he put in his place? Gen. Mc-Do-well had
met with de-feat. Gen. Pat-ter-son, too, had failed. Up
to that date the on-ly off-i-cer who had won was Gen.
Mc-Clel-lan, in charge of O-hi-o troops in West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Vir-gin-ia. Gen. Scott spoke to Pres-i-dent Lin-coln in
fa-vor of this young man, Mc-Clel-lan, and, as it was not
ea-sy to find just the one need-ed at that hour,
Mc-Clel-lan was kept
at Wash-ing-ton to
or-gan-ize the troops
com-ing in to that
cit-y and make all
read-y for a strong
cam-paign.</p>

<div class="caption">GENERAL WINFIELD SCOTT</div>
</div>

<p>The fine fall days
were go-ing by and
Mc-Clel-lan, though
he seemed to be get-ting
read-y for work,
did not bring a-bout
what folks thought
he would. They be-gan
to ask why the ar-my did not move. Word was
sent North each night that it was “All qui-et a-long the
Po-to-mac!”</p>

<p>Ere the end of Sep-tem-ber came it was clear-ly made
known to the Pres-i-dent that the friends of the Un-ion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
cause felt that some of the lead-ers were at fault. The
Pres-i-dent, as a boy, had made him-self mas-ter of
gram-mar, law, sur-vey-ing, and oth-er things, and now
he made a close stud-y of war and how to fight great
bat-tles. While he was a help to Mc-Clel-lan, yet he
saw, at last, that his own plans were best, and so, in
time, it was proved to all that Mc-Clel-lan was wrong
and Lin-coln was right.</p>

<p>Not a-lone in war schemes but in oth-ers the hand and
head of Lin-coln oft-en proved bet-ter than those of
men who had been brought up to such work. Lin-coln’s
way with for-eign lands, some of whose ru-lers
were friend-ly to the South and want-ed it to win, was
thought to be just right. Then the way Lin-coln got
vast sums to car-ry on the war, and the part he thought
it wise for the na-vy to take in the great strife, won
praise for him. These things were all un-der Lin-coln’s
eye and had his close care.</p>

<p>As time went on the whole North learned to look to
Lin-coln, and de-pend up-on him for help in dark days
and wise work in bright times. When the North felt
they could not win, Lin-coln said, “We shall win!”</p>

<p>While a large force of men was in arms not much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
had been done by Un-ion Gen-er-als. Mc-Clel-lan’s
great ar-my grew less and less. Hordes of men were ill.
Mc-Clel-lan had no plan for his troops to move. Hal-leck
was in charge in Mis-sou-ri and Gen. Bu-ell in
Ken-tuc-ky.</p>

<p>Pres-i-dent Lin-coln saw that a un-ion must be
brought a-bout be-tween the moves of these three lead-ers.
He wrote to them, but they did not care to do
what he thought best.</p>

<p>U-lys-ses S. Grant, though a West Point man who
had fought in the war with Mex-i-co in 1843, had left
the ar-my and gone to a small farm near St. Lou-is. He
was poor, but he built a small house of hewn logs for his
fam-i-ly, did his own work on the land, and lived a life
of peace.</p>

<p>A chance came to go to Ga-le-na, in the State of Il-li-nois.
There Grant was a clerk in a store where they
sold hides. There he was when the war broke out, and
the South and the North, which had been as one, were
now two, and full of hate.</p>

<p>Four days af-ter Lin-coln’s call for troops went
through the land, U. S. Grant be-gan to drill some of
the men in his place in the use of the gun. In a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
days he set off with them for Spring-field, Ill. From
there he wrote to a man who held a high post at Wash-ing-ton
and told him that he would like to be of use
and help save the land from its foe.</p>

<p>No word came back. But Grant kept on, staid in
the same cit-y, and gave his time to the drill of all the
troops he could find.</p>

<p>In five weeks’ time Cap-tain Grant was made Colo-nel
and sent off to the seat of war at the head of the
21st Il-li-nois. He went first to Mis-sou-ri and then to
Cai-ro. Soon, with-out ask-ing for the post, he was
made Brig-a-dier-Gen-er-al.</p>

<p>A force of the foe, led by Gen. Polk, went up the
Mis-sis-sip-pi from Mem-phis and took the high bluffs
at Co-lum-bus, in Ken-tuc-ky.</p>

<p>A man from Co-lum-bus said, “The Con-fed-er-ates are
get-ting read-y to seize Pa-du-cah!” Pa-du-cah was a
place which would be of great worth to the side which
first got hold of it. If the guns of the foe were put
there they would stop steam-boats from pass-ing that
point.</p>

<p>Gen. Grant saw that he must act at once. There was
no time in which to wait for or-ders from the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the troops in the West. The ver-y next morn-ing the
folks who lived in Pa-du-cah were great-ly sur-prised to
see a fleet of steam-boats full of Un-ion troops made
fast at the wharf. The na-tives had been told that the
for-ces of the South were to be there that day, and they
had gone to the quay to greet Gen. Thom-as who was
to lead those troops.</p>

<p>Grant’s quick move gave Ken-tuc-ky to the Un-ion
cause and much cheer to Pres-i-dent Lin-coln.</p>

<p>The first fight of the war in which Grant took the
lead was af-ter he moved his troops from Pa-du-cah
down to Hun-ter’s Point, near Bel-mont.</p>

</div>

<p>Pres-i-dent Lin-coln strove to have a un-i-ty of ac-tion
be-tween his gen-er-als. Mc-Clel-lan had a great force
at hand. He did naught with it but drill and wait.
Hal-leck had charge in Mis-sou-ri and Bu-ell in Ken-tuc-ky.
They had noth-ing to do with each oth-er.</p>

<p>Pres-i-dent Lin-coln told Hal-leck to men-ace Co-lum-bus
on the Mis-sis-sip-pi and Bu-ell at the same time to
move up-on the force un-der John-ston, at Bowl-ing
Green in cen-tral Ken-tuc-ky. These men did not do as
the Pres-i-dent had told them to, and they did not e-ven
an-swer his let-ter or or-der. Then it was that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Pres-i-dent felt that the three com-mand-ers were not
do-ing what they ought to do, in fact, that they were
“three do-noth-ings.”</p>

<p>There were bad times in eas-tern Ten-nes-see, where
the folks had giv-en out that they were for the Un-ion.
The foe in Geor-gi-a and Tex-as took man-y of them
and put them in jail for so do-ing. Those who got off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
told tales of great dis-tress. Lin-coln want-ed Bu-ell to
help them but he would-n’t.</p>

<p>In the East there was much talk of Mc-Clel-lan’s
long wait. The Pres-i-dent was ver-y pa-tient, too pa-tient
folks said. A-gain and a-gain Lin-coln went to
Mc-Clel-lan to get him to start work with his large
for-ces.</p>

<p>In the West there were two men who felt that they
could do a good stroke for the Un-ion if they had leave
to do it. One of these men was Com-mo-dore Foote.
The oth-er was Gen-er-al Grant.</p>

<p>It was on Feb. 2, 1862, that the first great move was
made af-ter Bull Run. This broke the line of the foe
at the West and gave the Mis-sis-sip-pi Riv-er, a-bove
Vicks-burg, in-to the hands of the North.</p>

<p>Com. Foote, with four gun-boats, and Gen. Grant
with his troops, moved a-gainst Fort Hen-ry on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Ten-nes-see Riv-er, and on Feb. 2d, made it give up.
A week went by and on the Cum-ber-land Riv-er, which
there runs near the Ten-nes-see Riv-er, an-oth-er fort of
the foe, Don-el-son, twelve miles from Fort Hen-ry, was
tak-en by the same men. There was a stiff fight at Fort
Don-el-son and 2,300 of Un-ion sol-diers fell. At last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
that fort was tak-en and 15,000 pris-on-ers with it. All
the troops of the foe then had to leave the State of
Ken-tuc-ky. All the friends of the Un-ion cause
were full of joy.</p>

<br />
<div class="caption">THE ATTACK ON FORT DONELSON.</div>
</div>

<p>Just in the midst of the great good news from the
West came a thing most sad to the hearts of the Pres-i-dent’s
fam-i-ly. One dear boy fell ill. It was Wil-lie
Lin-coln.</p>

<p>While full of the weight of cares for his land, there
came nights and days when it fell to Lin-coln’s lot to
have to watch the slow steps of death. “It is the hard-est
tri-al of my life,” said the sad fa-ther. At last the dear
child was gone. One said to the Pres-i-dent, “A vast
num-ber pray for you to-day.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lin-coln said “I am glad of that. I want them
to pray for me. I need their pray-ers; and I will try
to go to God with my sor-row. I wish I had a child-like
faith. I trust God will give it to me. My moth-er
had it. She died man-y years a-go. I re-mem-ber her
pray-ers; they have al-ways fol-lowed me. They have
clung to me through life.”</p>

<p>A new style of boat, a small queer craft, was brought
forth by the war. She did a great work in Hamp-ton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Roads when ships of wood of the North, as they lay at
an-chor there, had gone down, when shot at and
“rammed” by a new sort of foe.</p>

<p>The Se-cret-a-ry of the Na-vy at that time was Mr.
Welles. He heard that the foe were to raise the hull
of the “Mer-ri-mac,” a fine craft which the foe had hurt
and sunk at Nor-folk. They would raise the ship, cov-er
it with i-ron, and thus make a ves-sel which would
be of far more use in war than an-y thing then built.</p>

<p>The As-sist-ant-Sec’y of the Na-vy, Mr. Gus-ta-vus
V. Fox, went to talk with the Pres-i-dent. Lin-coln
spoke to him a-bout the new craft and said:</p>

<p>“We must not let the foe get a-head of us in such an
im-por-tant thing as pla-ting ves-sels with i-ron.”</p>

<p>This thought sank deep in-to the mind of Mr. Fox,
and plans were soon set on foot to see what could be
done to get some “i-ron-clads.” Capt. Er-ics-son made
a mod-el of a craft ne’er be-fore seen. It had a hull
un-der wa-ter, and an i-ron-clad tur-ret which could be
turned.</p>

<p>The Pres-i-dent was glad of Er-ics-son’s work, took
the plans, and eight months lat-er the worth of the boat
made from them was seen in the great fight be-tween<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the Mer-ri-mac and the Mon-i-tor at Hamp-ton Roads.
The “Mer-ri-mac” thought she would have full swing
and crush all the ships of the Un-ion. She did some
sad work both in the loss of ships and men, and she
would have made an end of all, had there not, at mid-night,
come up-on the scene, straight down from New
York, John Er-ics-son’s lit-tle i-ron ves-sel, the “Mon-i-tor.”
From that time i-ron ships, in place of those
made of wood, were made for war use.</p>

<p>In the West, Grant, when he got through with Don-el-son,
went up the Ten-nes-see to take Cor-inth in North
Mis-sis-sip-pi. At that place man-y rail-roads met.
Fresh troops had been sent from the East, and as Grant
moved on with them he left some at points where boats
could land. He, him-self, came to a halt on the west
bank of the stream, at Shi-loh, with 30,000 to 40,000
men. This was a good place for him, for from here he
could keep watch on the rail-road that went through
the South and thus vex the foe then in great force at
Cor-inth.</p>

<p>The foe had, at its head, Gen. A. S. John-ston and
it was his wish to crush Grant ere Bu-ell could send
him more troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Shi-loh, a small log church, was on a ridge a few
miles back from Pitts-burg Land-ing. The troops that
were to be put in front had their lines drawn up to face
the Cor-inth road, for by that route the foe must come.
Gen. Sher-man had charge of the men on that line.</p>

<div class="caption">THE CHURCH AT SHILOH.</div>
</div>

<p>It was on A-pril 6th, 1862, that Gen. A. S. John-ston
made a fierce at-tack on the lines at Shi-loh.
There was great loss on both sides. Sher-man was
twice shot, while horse af-ter horse fell un-der him, but
he stuck to his work, and kept up the hearts of his men.</p>

<p>The next day the fight went on a-gain and ground
was won and lost on both sides. New troops, which
had come in the night to the boys in blue, gave them
much hope and did fine work. At last it was push,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
push, the foe back so that they could gain no more
ground. This went on, till, at three o’clock the cry of
“Charge!” rang out up-on the air. With loud cheers,
and their guns held in front of them, the Un-ion troops
made a bold brave dash and drove the foe from the
field.</p>

<div class="caption">THE LAST CHARGE AT SHILOH.</div>

<p>The loss was great on both sides. When the foe
lost their lead-er, Gen. A. S. John-ston, they lost heart,
and be-ing much worn by hours of dire work, had to
give up.</p>

<p>Af-ter Shi-loh, a move was made a-gainst Cor-inth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a-bout 22 miles off. Word had gone forth that Beau-re-gard
had a large force of South-ern troops with him
at that place, but when the Un-ion ar-my came close,
the foe fled from it, and left most of it in flames. When
the Un-ion troops came, it was found that a brave show
had been made with a lot of old guns made of wood, in
the place of the i-ron sort which could do harm.</p>

<div class="caption">SOUTHERN TROOPS LEAVING CORINTH.</div>
</div>

<p>The Un-ion cause, by this last step, held the Mis-sis-sip-pi
Riv-er as far down as Vicks-burg.</p>

<p>Pres-i-dent Lin-coln’s heart was glad at the strong
work in the West, the news of which came to him but
a few weeks af-ter he had heard from the South that
Ad-mir-al Far-ra-gut and Gen. But-ler held the cit-y of
New Or-leans.</p>

<p>Far-ra-gut then went up the Mis-sis-sip-pi as far as
Vicks-burg and it was thought then that the whole riv-er
would soon be held by Un-ion for-ces.</p>

<p>The gains by the boys in blue at that time made a
stir in the South and then it was that each man who
could bear arms had to take part in the war.</p>

<p>The men who led the troops of the South did strong
work for their cause. In 1861 there were fights big and
small and most of these were won by the South. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
1862 the war went on and the North won some hard
fights, though at times there were great loss-es and dark
days. The South bore up well, and though crops were
poor, and they could not get goods, still they fought as
brave-ly as ev-er, and felt that they should at last win.
In Vir-gin-ia, the foe had some grand men to lead
them, and for a time it seemed as if they must win.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
They were bound to-geth-er with strong ties, and heart,
head, and hand, each, did its best.</p>

<p>When Lin-coln came to be Pres-i-dent it was well
known that he had a great dis-like to sla-ver-y. But
the war, as he said, time af-ter time, was “not fought
to put down sla-ver-y but to save the Un-ion.” At the
North man-y found fault with Lin-coln be-cause he did
not make haste to set the slaves free. The Pres-i-dent
plain-ly said, “If I could save the Un-ion, though I did
not free a slave I would do it. Still, in my own heart
it is my wish, that all men, in all lands, should be free.”
Lin-coln tried hard to keep the bor-der states friend-ly
to the Un-ion cause. One way that would have made
them foes would have been to free the slaves at once.</p>

<p>One day, while sail-ing down the Po-to-mac Riv-er,
en route to the ar-my for a vis-it, the Pres-i-dent wrote
out some thoughts on this theme which had been in his
mind for a long time. Then, when Con-gress had
made an end of its work, af-ter hav-ing passed an act
“tak-ing a-way the prop-er-ty” of the foe, there was a
meet-ing of the cab-i-net, made up of men who were a
help to the Pres-i-dent.</p>

<p>Slaves were “prop-er-ty” and as prop-er-ty was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
seized, slaves, of course, could be tak-en. They were at
that time at work as team-sters and on forts. Why,
then, would it not be a good time to give them their
free-dom? With this ques-tion in his mind, the Pres-i-dent
went to his desk and took from it a pa-per which
he then read to his “cab-i-net.” It said; “On and af-ter
the first day of Jan-u-a-ry, 1863, all slaves with-in
a-ny state or states where the con-sti-tu-tion-al
au-thor-i-ty of the U-ni-ted States shall not be re-cog-nized,
sub-mit-ted to, and main-tained, shall thence-for-ward
and for-ev-er be free.”</p>

<p>The Pres-i-dent told those to whom he had read his
“draft” that he had not called them to ask their ad-vice
but to place the mat-ter be-fore them.</p>

<p>The wise Se-cret-a-ry Sew-ard said that though he
was in fa-vor of such a draft, he thought the time was
not ripe for it. He thought it would be best to wait
un-til the troops had won more fights. It was then de-cid-ed
that at least some months should go by ere this
“draft” should be made known.</p>

</div>


<p>It is true that while good strokes were made in the
West, the East did not do her part to put down the
foe as soon as she might have done, and this was laid to
lead-ers, for the troops were brave and read-y to fight
when they had a chance.</p>

<p>What was called “The Pen-in-su-lar Cam-paign”
made a start ’twixt the York Riv-er and the James
Riv-er, on land which forms a pen-in-su-la.</p>

<p>Here through the spring and sum-mer of 1862, Mc-Clel-lan
held large for-ces. There was much fight-ing,
and at one time the Un-ion for-ces were with-in eight
miles of Rich-mond, but in the end they had to fall back
and with-draw from the Pen-in-su-la.</p>

<p>Pres-i-dent Lin-coln at length felt that Mc-Clel-lan
was no match for the Con-fed-er-ate Gen-er-als, Lee and
“Stone-wall” Jack-son. So he had to put a new man
at the head of the ar-my in the East. This man was
Gen. Pope who had done well in the West.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came the sec-ond Bull Run fight, Au-gust 29
and 30, 1862. The foe won. Lin-coln found Pope
“not up to the mark,” as a lead-er, and so put Mc-Clel-lan
back once more.</p>

<p>It was on the 16th and 17th of Sept. 1862, that Mc-Clel-lan
and Lee fought at An-tie-tam Creek, near
Sharps-burg, in Ma-ry-land. This was one of the most
se-vere bat-tles of the war. On Sept. 18, Lee with-drew
a-cross the Po-to-mac, and Mc-Clel-lan slow-ly went af-ter
him.</p>

<p>The Pres-i-dent had wait-ed in hopes that a “vic-to-ry”
would come to the ar-my of the East, ere he
made known his plan of free-ing slaves in some of the
states. His own words are, “I had made a sol-emn
vow to God that if Lee were driv-en back from Ma-ry-land
I would crown the re-sult by a dec-la-ra-tion of
free-dom to the slaves.”</p>

<p>So when the An-tie-tam fight came, and Lee and
troops were driv-en back from Ma-ry-land, it gave so
much hope to the Un-ion cause that Lin-coln felt it was
the time to send forth the “draft” he made two months
be-fore. This pa-per said that on the first day of Jan-u-a-ry,
1863, all slaves in those states which had left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Un-ion should be free. The slaves in those states
which had <em>not</em> gone off, such as Mis-sou-ri and Ken-tuc-ky,
were not <em>then</em> to be free.</p>

<p>It had been thought by some that harm would come
from this pa-per, but it did not. It was a wise move,
and a bold one, and brought much good.</p>

<p>Great joy was felt at the North, and fresh hope came
with the thought that the war might soon be at an end.
But there were two more years of sad, sad work, loss,
and death on both sides.</p>

<p>The Pres-i-dent had found that it would be best for
Mc-Clel-lan to give up his post “for good.” Burn-side
took his place, but it was soon seen that he was too
rash.</p>

<p>His plan was to cross the Rap-pa-han-nock at Fred-er-icks-burg
and strike at the foe on the heights back
of the town on Dec. 13, 1862. There was great loss of
life and no gain. The foe won.</p>

<p>Gen. Hoo-ker was the next man to take charge of
the ar-my in the East, but no moves were made till
May, ’63.</p>

<p>In the mean time a great deal was done in the West.
Grant once more made a move a-gainst Vicks-burg, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of the two strong points on the Mis-sis-sip-pi Riv-er
still held by the foe. The North had, at times, thought
Grant “slow” but Lin-coln had great trust in him, and
said, “Wait. Give him a chance.”</p>

<p>Vicks-burg is on the east bank of the riv-er. Grant’s
aim was to get to his troops and gun-boats be-low the
town, and the plan he took was to march his men down
the west bank, and let the gun-boats run past the
eight miles of bat-ter-ies.</p>

<br />
<div class="caption">GUNBOATS ON THE MISSISSIPPI.</div>
</div>

<p>It was a-bout the mid-dle of A-pril, 1863, when the
gun-boats passed the bat-ter-ies. The troops marched
down the west bank of the riv-er, and then crossed in
boats to the east side, at a point where they could reach
the foe. On the first of May there was a fight near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Port Gib-son with the fore-guard of Gen. Pem-ber-ton’s
ar-my. Here the foe soon had more of the South-ern
troops come to help him, led by Gen. John-ston.
Grant saw a chance to get be-tween these two sets of
troops, and on May 14, 1863, he put down John-ston.
Then he beat Pem-ber-ton in two more fights at Cham-pi-on
Hills and at Black Riv-er. So the foe had to
flee, for safe-ty, to Vicks-burg, where Grant had made
up his mind to take him, af-ter a while, with all the rest
of the foe he could find in that cit-y.</p>

<p>Then came the Siege of Vicks-burg which went on for
near-ly sev-en weeks. The foe held out as long as there
was a crust of bread left. Grant said he should stay
there till he took the town.</p>

<div class="caption">FIRST CHARGE AT VICKSBURG.</div>
</div>

<p>These were his words;</p>

<p>“I can-not tell just when I shall take the town, but
I mean to stay till I do, if it takes me thir-ty years.”</p>

<p>The end came on Ju-ly 4, 1863. The foe sent up
white flags on all their lines and the men of the South
filed out and stacked their arms in front of the Un-ion
for-ces.</p>

<p>Grant rode in-to Vicks-burg at head of Lo-gan’s
corps. He was proud of his troops and that the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
had won. The news flew fast o’er the land. Lin-coln
sent strong words of thanks to Grant, gave him high
praise, and made him Ma-jor Gen-er-al.</p>

<p>At the same time that Grant was at work on the
Vicks-burg Siege, Un-ion troops, led by Gen. N. P.
Banks, fought to get Port Hud-son which lay at the
south end of the reb-el part of the riv-er. At last it
had to yield, and on Ju-ly 9, 1863, it hauled down its
flag of stars and bars. Then the brave “boys in blue”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
marched in and flung out the star-span-gled ban-ner
to the breeze. From that time on the great Mis-sis-sip-pi
Riv-er was a safe road-way for all un-armed craft
which flew the stars and stripes.</p>

<p>In the East, in the Spring of ’63, Hoo-ker fought the
“Chan-cel-lors-ville Cam-paign” and lost. Then, on
May 6th, he re-crossed the Rap-pa-han-nock.</p>

<p>Lee had tak-en his ar-my a-cross the Po-to-mac and
was in Penn-syl-va-ni-a.</p>

<p>Hoo-ker’s place was giv-en to Gen. George G. Meade.
The Un-ion ar-my and the foe met on the first day of
Ju-ly, 1863. Friends of each side, North and South,
held their breath with fear.</p>

<p>Lee, who had been so strong in de-fence was now to
prove, for the last time, what he could do in at-tack.
His plan to move in-to Penn-syl-va-ni-a was a good one,
but Jack-son, who had long been a great help to him,
was hurt and could not be there. Lee felt this loss.</p>

<p>June 3, 1863, Lee marched up the Val-ley of Shen-an-do-ah
to-wards Cham-bers-burg. The Un-ion ar-my
too took the same course, but on the oth-er, or eas-tern,
side of the Blue Ridge. “Stu-art’s Cav-al-ry” held the
pass-es and this kept the Un-ion troops from know-ing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
what went on on the west-ern side. Lee’s ar-my was the
best of all the foe. Af-ter cross-ing the Po-to-mac the
two ar-mies looked for each oth-er. Lee, fac-ing east, was
com-ing from the west of the town of Get-tys-burg, and
Meade was tak-ing his post on Cem-e-ter-y Ridge, at
the south. It was not thought that a bat-tle, by all,
would then be-gin, but “Meade’s Cav-al-ry,” led by Bu-ford,
came up-on Lee’s front guard on Ju-ly 1, 1863,
and they fought. The Un-ion men were forced back
and had loss-es. Night then came on, and by that time
both sides, each with a-bout 80,000 men, were in the
moon-light up-on the ground. The troops were in good
trim and of high cour-age. On the next day the foe
car-ried works at both ends of the Un-ion line. The
third day the Un-ion ar-my got back the lost ground on
its right. The foe then made a fierce charge and broke
through the cen-tre of the Un-ion ar-my, but were at
last put down and sent back. The end of the charge
was the end of the bat-tle and point-ed to the end of the
war. In this fight Lee lost 36,000 men. With those
he lost the first time he made a thrust at the North,
and these, 90,000 of some of the best troops in the
world laid down their lives for the cause they held dear.</p>

<div class="caption">ARMY WAGON.</div>
</div>

<p>Meade, at this time, lost 23,000 men. The Un-ion
was saved. Meade let Lee go slow-ly a-cross the Po-to-mac.
One more move was made by Lee two or
three months lat-er in a quick dash o’er the Rap-i-dan,
with the thought that he might get a-round Meade’s
right flank. But Meade was too bright to be thus
caught. Then he tried the same game on Lee but with
no gain, and so the “Cam-paign of 1863,” in the East,
came to an end.</p>

<p>The great news that the Un-ion troops had won at
Get-tys-burg, and that the Un-ion for-ces had al-so won
in the West, and that the whole Mis-sis-sip-pi Riv-er
was in the hands of the boys in blue, flashed o’er the
wires with-in a few days of each oth-er.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Pres-i-dent Lin-coln’s heart was made glad. The sad
look left his face. When some one in a high post at
Wash-ing-ton asked him if he had not felt “great anx-i-e-ty”
a-bout the fate of the Un-ion cause at Get-tys-burg,
he said he “Thought it would all come out right.”
Then came the ques-tion, “Why?” At first Lin-coln
did not speak, then he said:</p>

<p>“Be-fore the bat-tle I went a-lone to my room in the
White House and prayed to Al-migh-ty God to give
us the vic-to-ry. I said to Him that this was His war,
and that if He would stand by the na-tion now, I would
stand by Him the rest of my life. He gave us the vic-to-ry,
and I pro-pose to keep my pledge. I rose from
my knees with a feel-ing of deep and se-rene con-fi-dence
and had no doubt of the re-sult from that hour.”</p>

<p>Get-tys-burg, Vicks-burg, and Port Hud-son made a
turn-ing point in his-to-ry.</p>

<small>CHATTANOOGA, CHICKAMAUGA, LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN.
LINCOLN’S GETTYSBURG SPEECH.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>In the West the war was now in two parts. The Un-ion
troops had won their first point, which was to hold
the Mis-sis-sip-pi Riv-er. But there had to be a long,
fierce fight ere they could gain cen-tral Ten-nes-see and
north Geor-gi-a. The foe led by Bragg, and the Un-ion
troops by Ro-se-crans fought their best but it was not
till the warm months, and the fall of 1863 that Ro-se-crans,
at last, made Bragg fall back, bit by bit, un-til
Chat-ta-noo-ga was in the hands of the Un-ion for-ces.
Then more of the foe went to help Bragg, and the great
fight of Chick-a-mau-ga came on Sept. 19 and 20, 1863.</p>

<p>The first day the Un-ion ar-my won; but the next
day the right half of Ro-se-crans’ ar-my was bro-ken
and fled to Chat-ta-noo-ga. George H. Thom-as, a
brave man and a hard fight-er, by great skill held the
left wing a-gainst charge af-ter charge that the foe made
up-on it, and gave Ro-se-crans time to take such steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
as would make safe the Un-ion men who had fled to
Chat-ta-noo-ga.</p>

<p>Grant then had all the troops west of the moun-tains
in his charge. He
gave Ro-se-crans’
place to Thom-as,
who was called
“The Rock of
Chick-a-mau-ga.”
Grant him-self, with
Thom-as next, then
took com-mand of
the be-sieged for-ces
at Chat-ta-noo-ga.</p>

<p>Some of Bragg’s
men had been sent
off to make a strike at Burn-side in East Ten-nes-see,
so Grant saw that he had a good chance to make a
move on the rear of Bragg’s ar-my.</p>

<p>The line of the foe was twelve miles long, ’twixt Mis-sion-a-ry
Ridge on the east and Look-out Moun-tain on
the south. The last is a height which makes a sharp
rise of 2,000 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Grant’s plan was to have his troops climb the two
heights and storm the works that had been built on
them. If he could take them, he would then com-mand
the val-ley in which Bragg’s troops lay, and could force
him to give up the siege. He gave Hoo-ker the task of
mak-ing a strike at Look-out Moun-tain and Sher-man
had his work to do at the Ridge.</p>

<div class="caption">AT MISSIONARY RIDGE.</div>
</div>

<p>There was a dense mist on the morn-ing of Nov. 23.
Sher-man went to work and got up-on the north end of
the Ridge, while Hoo-ker did his part on Look-out
Moun-tain. Hoo-ker’s troops fought their way right up
to the top and when there flung to the breeze the stars
and stripes.</p>

<p>Grant stood on Or-chard Knob and gave the or-der
for 20,000 men to take a line of earth works which lay
at the base of the Ridge. This they did and Grant
then saw that the time was ripe for a great move. He
gave the word for a charge to be made a-long the whole
line of bat-tle.</p>

<img src="images/i_118.jpg" width="600" height="320" alt="a" title="a" />
<div class="caption">A CHARGE ALL ALONG THE LINE.</div>
</div>

<p>The day drew near its close. The shad-ow of Look-out
Moun-tain fell far a-cross the plain. The last rays
of the sun, ere it sank from sight, shone bright on the
arms of the troops as on they came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Fierce was the fire which struck them, but on they
went up the steep height, climb, climb as best they
could, with the flags wav-ing be-yond them.</p>

<p>When the sun went down, with it went the hopes of
the foe, for they fled and their own guns were turned
up-on them.</p>

<p>Af-ter the bat-tle of Chat-ta-noo-ga, East Ten-nes-see
was in the hands of Un-ion troops. The troops of the
South that had held the field there, re-tired to guard
Geor-gi-a, Al-a-bam-a, and North and South Car-o-li-na.</p>

<p>The State of Penn-syl-va-ni-a bought a part of the
Get-tys-burg bat-tle-field for a place of bur-i-al for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Un-ion sol-diers who there had fought their last fight.
On Nov. 19, 1863, that rest-ing place for the dead
was to be “con-se-cra-ted.” Ed-ward Ev-e-rett, of Mas-sa-chu-setts,
was to give the o-ra-tion, or chief speech of
the day.</p>

<p>Some one told Pres-i-dent Lin-coln, that he, too,
might be asked to speak. He said he would “put some
stray thoughts to-geth-er,” and so, while in the cars on
his way from the White House to the bat-tle-field, he
took a pen-cil from his pock-et, and on bits of pa-per
wrote the best speech of his life and one of the great-est
speech-es of the world.</p>

<p>Each word was of use. There were 267 words in all
and they came straight from Lin-coln’s heart. Here
they are:</p>

<p>“Four score and sev-en years a-go our fa-thers
brought forth on this con-ti-nent a new na-tion, con-ceived
in lib-er-ty, and ded-i-ca-ted to the prop-o-si-tion
that all men are cre-a-ted e-qual. Now we are en-gaged
in a great civ-il war, test-ing wheth-er that na-tion or
an-y na-tion so con-ceived and so ded-i-ca-ted can long
en-dure. We are met on a great bat-tle-field of that
war. We have come to ded-i-cate a por-tion of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
field as a fin-al rest-ing place for those who here gave
their lives that that na-tion might live. It is al-to-geth-er
fit-ting and pro-per that we should do this. But, in
a lar-ger sense, we can-not ded-i-cate—we can-not con-se-crate—we
can-not hal-low this ground. The brave
men, liv-ing and dead, who strug-gled here, have con-se-cra-ted
it far a-bove our poor pow-er to add or de-tract.</p>

<p>“The world will lit-tle note, nor long re-mem-ber,
what we say here; but it can nev-er for-get what they
did here. It is for us, the liv-ing, rath-er to be ded-i-ca-ted
here to the great task re-main-ing be-fore us—that,
from these hon-ored dead, we take in-creased de-vo-tion
to that cause for which they gave the last full
meas-ure of de-vo-tion; that we here high-ly re-solve
that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this
na-tion, un-der God, shall have a new birth of free-dom,
and that gov-ern-ment of the peo-ple, by the peo-ple,
for the peo-ple shall not per-ish from the earth.”</p>

<small>GRANT IN THE EAST. LINCOLN CHOSEN FOR SECOND TERM.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Grant for his great work in the West was made Lieu-ten-ant
Gen-er-al, and put in charge of all the for-ces of
the Un-ion. He came East, and took the Ar-my of
the Po-to-mac in-to his strong safe hands, and Pres-i-dent
Lin-coln saw that he would fight to the end.</p>

<p>Then the Ar-my of the Po-to-mac un-der Grant and
Meade made a move to-ward Rich-mond. It met Lee in
dense woods known as “The Wil-der-ness,” and there,
and in and a-bout Spott-syl-va-ni-a Court House, fought
for 16 days. The Un-ion ar-my lost 37,000 men. Lee,
who led the foe, lost vast hordes, still he would not give
up. Grant saw that he must get near-er to Rich-mond
and this he did in a qui-et way by send-ing off a part of
his ar-my from his right and march-ing it a-round to
the rear of his oth-er troops. Then he pushed it as far
a-head as he could on his left. Though “out-flanked,”
Lee would fall back in time to be a-gain twixt Grant’s
troops and Rich-mond. With troops so well matched
it was hard for ei-ther to win.</p>

<p>On June 3, 1864, Grant and his men were so near
Rich-mond, at a place called Cold Har-bor, that the
Un-ion for-ces made a
strike at the works of
the foe a-long the whole
line. In one hours’
time near 6,000 Un-ion
men met death.</p>

<p>When ten days had
gone by a quick march
to the left was made
by Grant’s ar-my and
they all got a-cross the
James Riv-er. They
tried to take Pe-ters-burg
so that they
could cut off one source of the stores sent to the foe, but
they found the works too strong to be seized by storm.
Then the Un-ion troops built trench-es close up to the
foe’s works and staid there nine months.</p>

<p>On the 21st of June, Pres-i-dent Lin-coln rode out to
the front. On his way back he had to pass some
black troops who had fought well in the first charge on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Pe-ters-burg. These men had been slaves, and Lin-coln
was the good friend who had set them free. They
crowd-ed round him with tears in their eyes, and gave
cheers of joy. They laughed and cried, and pressed
up to him to shake or kiss his hand, to touch his
clothes, or the horse on which he rode. The scene
moved Mr. Lin-coln
to tears, and he could
not trust him-self to
speak.</p>

<div class="caption">LINCOLN AND THE BLACK TROOPS.</div>

<p>There had been,
through all the years
of the war, fights on a
small scale in the Val-ley
of Vir-gin-ia, and
each side had a chance
to win from time to
time.</p>

<p>At last Gen-er-al
Sher-i-dan was put in
charge of the Un-ion
troops on that line, but held off from a great fight till
Sept. 19, ’64, when he won at Win-ches-ter and three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
days lat-er at Fish-er’s Hill a-gainst the foe un-der Ear-ly.
Sher-i-dan took all the stock from the Val-ley and
burned barns full of grain, so the foe would not find
food there, but still Ear-ly sent a part of his men af-ter
the Un-ion troops, mov-ing so that his for-ces would not
make a noise in the night on a lone-path till they got to
a place where the Un-ion troops were sound a-sleep.
The rest of his ar-my, Ear-ly kept by him to strike at
Sher-i-dan’s force in front. The bat-tle of Ce-dar Creek
came then twixt these two ar-mies. The foe won.
Sher-i-dan was not there but heard the guns and rode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
up the Val-ley full speed, and with a shout to his men
who had fled, “Come, boys, we’re go-ing back!” turned
the tide and put down the Ear-ly troops. There were
but few more fights, just there, for both sides had to go
to Pe-ters-burg for the last scenes.</p>

<div class="caption">“COME, BOYS, WE’RE GOING BACK!”</div>
</div>

<p>While the ar-my did its best in war work, the na-vy,
too, or men of the sea, did brave deeds.</p>

<p>Ad-mir-al Far-ra-gut, who had done so much good
work with his fleet from the North in the Spring of 1862,
brought fame once more to him-self in his at-tack on
Mo-bile in Au-gust, 1864. So that he might see and di-rect
his fleet of i-ron-clads and ships of wood in the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
way, Far-ra-gut went up in-to the main-top of the
“Hart-ford,” and at last took the forts in Mo-bile Bay.
He closed the port, though the town was kept in the
hands of the foe till the war came to an end.</p>

<p>In De-cem-ber, 1864, when Con-gress met, the doom
of the foe was in sight. Grant had Pe-ters-burg in his
grip, and said he would “see the end of the job.”</p>

<p>With Lee’s ar-my at Rich-mond, the on-ly oth-er
<em>large</em> force of the foe was led by John-ston in the south.
Sher-man with a lar-ger force made a move a-gainst it,
and af-ter much fight-ing John-ston took his stand at
At-lan-ta. He had fought with much skill, but the
South failed to see this, and put Gen. Hood in his place.
Hood was rash, and Sher-man soon forced him to leave
At-lan-ta. From At-lan-ta, Sher-man set out on his
great “March through Geor-gi-a,” burn-ing At-lan-ta
when he left, so that it might not a-gain be a ref-uge
for the foe.</p>

<p>In the midst of all the strife, Lin-coln’s first term as
Chief came to an end. It was asked by some, “What
new man shall we put in Lin-coln’s place?” Names
came up, but it was hard to find a new man who “knew
the ropes.” Lin-coln, though worn with toil, had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
great wish to keep his post, for he felt that he had not
then done his full work. In his quaint way he said to
his friends:</p>

<p>“It is-n’t safe to swap hor-ses when you are cross-ing
a stream.”</p>

<p>In No-vem-ber, 1864, Lin-coln was once more the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
choice of the peo-ple. They told him that it was their
wish that he should lead them, be their Chief for one
more term, and take the
chair on the fourth of
March, 1865.</p>

<p>When that day came,
A-bra-ham Lin-coln
stood on the por-ti-co of
the cap-i-tol and took the
oath of off-ice. The
cloud of war which hung
o’er the first in-au-gu-ra-tion,
was now a-bout to
leave. As the gloom went by, bright-er days came, and
the sun of a new e-ra shone out up-on the land.</p>

<p>The words which the Pres-i-dent said were few, but
they will nev-er die. While Lin-coln’s “Get-tys-burg
Speech” will ev-er be praised, far more must these last
words dwell in the hearts of men, for they show the de-vo-tion
and ten-der love of that great soul, poured out
to bless his chil-dren ere he lay down to die.</p>

<p>The woes of Lee and his troops grew too hard for
them to bear. Arms and food which had come to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
from the South and oth-er pla-ces were now cut off.
No more troops could join them and those who were
on the ground were weak for lack of food. The great
drama was soon to close.</p>

<p>Sher-man’s ar-my was in North Car-o-li-na. There
were, too, “Boys in Blue” in Charles-ton and Wil-ming-ton,
N. C. “Sher-i-dan’s Cav-al-ry” was en route
from the Shen-an-do-ah to Pe-ters-burg. The last blow
must come in a few weeks.</p>

<p>Lee knew that he and his men of the South must
hold Five Forks at all risks. They put up strong
breast works and did what they could to hold the land
a-bout Pe-ters-burg.</p>

<p>Grant’s force was
then twice as large as
Lee’s. Do the best he
might Lee found him-self
out-num-bered at
each tack and turn. The
Un-ion men beat the
foe and took hordes of
them pris-on-ers at the
great fight of Five Forks on A-pril 1, 1865. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
this fight went on, some of the foe’s works at Pe-ters-burg
were stormed and one by one they fell in-to the
hands of Grant’s men. But still Lee, on A-pril 2, when
night came on, held the line south of the Ap-po-mat-tox.
His men were worn out, for their work had been
hard and their food scarce.</p>

<p>As no news had come to Grant from Rich-mond,
he rode out to a line where he thought he could get
news and on his way a note was put in his hands from
Gen. Weit-zel. It said, “Rich-mond is ours. The foe
left in great haste and have set fire to the town.”</p>

<p>Then all a-long the line of the Un-ion troops came up
a great cry; “Rich-mond is ours! Rich-mond is ours!”</p>

<p>But, if Lee had left, the “Boys in Blue” must make
haste to catch him. He fled to the west with his starved
and worn-out troops, but Grant gave close chase and
Sher-i-dan “hung on his flanks.” Lee turned this way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and that, and there were some more fights, but at length
he had to give in. At a time when Sher-i-dan had his
men drawn up, and the word “Charge” was al-most on
his lips, a white flag was seen. The man who brought
it had come from Lee who was at Ap-po-mat-tox
Court House. Lee had sent to ask that there might
not be a fight till he knew what Grant’s terms of peace
were.</p>

<p>At last both great chiefs met to-geth-er in the small
town of Ap-po-mat-tox at a plain farm house.</p>

<p>They shook hands and Lee asked Grant to write out
his terms and said he would sign them. Grant drew
up the terms and Lee signed them as he had said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
would. Then the two great lead-ers shook hands a-gain
and both rode off. This was on the 9th of A-pril, 1865.</p>

<p>In the south, John-ston, who led the foe there, could
make no stand a-lone, so, at the end of 17 days, he gave
up to Gen. Sher-man. Small sets of the foe, placed
here and there, al-so gave up, and the four years of
blood came to an end.</p>

<p>The ar-mies of the Un-ion had put down the “Great
Re-bel-lion” and peace had come. So vast a war had
ne’er been known in mod-ern times, and men more
brave than those who fought on both sides could not be
found in an-y land.</p>

<p>“Pres-i-dent Lin-coln in Rich-mond,” af-ter the “Con-fed-er-a-cy”
fell to pie-ces, made a scene such as was ne’er
be-fore known in all his-to-ry. There was none of the
pomp and show such as a great chief in oth-er lands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
would have had who put down a brave foe and gained
a great cause.</p>

<p>Lin-coln was at the “head-quar-ters” of Gen. Grant
at Cit-y Point on a small steam-er, “The Riv-er
Queen,” when he heard of the fall of Rich-mond, and
that a great fire had laid low much of that place. He
went up the riv-er
and land-ed at a wharf
near Lib-by Pris-on.
There he found a
black man to act as
guide and show him
the way through the
cit-y. Soon a great
crowd drew near the
Pres-i-dent. The
Un-ion sol-diers greet-ed him, so did those who had
once been bought and sold like beasts. Cries of thanks
rent the air from the race he had made free. They felt
God had sent him.</p>

<div class="caption">UNION TROOPS MARCHING INTO RICHMOND.</div>
</div>

<p>The crowd was so dense that Ad-mir-al Por-ter had
to call sail-ors from his boat to march in front and be-hind
the Pres-i-dent, so that a track might be cleared for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
him through the town. Lin-coln did not seem to think
of fear, and no one raised a hand a-gainst him or spoke
an un-kind word.</p>

<p>The Pres-i-dent went to the house then used by Gen.
Weit-zel, who was in charge of the Un-ion troops there—the
same house in which Jef-fer-son Dav-is had lived
for months, and which he had just left in great haste.</p>

<p>Lib-by Pris-on was in that town, and there hordes of
some of the brav-est and best of the men of the North
had starved and died. Here, too, was a pris-on where
black slaves were kept. It was the “Rich-mond Mart”
with its cells and grates of i-ron. The end had come
for the pris-on, the whip, the shac-kles, the auc-tion-block
and dri-ver.</p>

<p>In the ear-ly morn of the day on which the foe’s
troops had marched out of Rich-mond, the or-der was
giv-en to burn the bridge o-ver which they passed. At
the same time, flames burst from win-dows and roofs of
tall build-ings, and in a few hours 800 of them were
on fire.</p>

<p>The poor folks of the town had their arms full of
house-hold goods, and stacks of beds, ta-bles, and chairs
were piled up in o-pen pla-ces. Groups of peo-ple stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
still in their fright, for their hou-ses were in ash-es and
they had no food or clothes.</p>

<p>A great hush, at last, fell on all, as the Pres-i-dent’s
coach was driv-en
to a stand in the
“Square.” Then
Lin-coln rose, faced
the great throng,
and spread out his
hands as a min-is-ter
would when
giv-ing a bless-ing.
Not a sound was
heard for more than
a min-ute. Then
the hor-ses went on
and Lin-coln was
gone.</p>

<p>One more vis-it was made by the Pres-i-dent to
Rich-mond. He then had his wife and his son “Tad”
with him. At that time he talked with Judge Camp-bell
a-bout the terms he would make with the foe. The
Judge had his own i-de-a of what he would like. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Lin-coln was not of the same mind, but said, “I will
give you in black and white my on-ly terms.”</p>

</div>

<p>These were plain and sim-ple. Lin-coln was kind
but he was firm.</p>

<p>Af-ter that the Lin-colns went to For-tress Mon-roe.
There, though the Pres-i-dent was wea-ry and full of
care, he spent hours with the sick and those in pain.
He talked of the grand news, of the Un-ion saved by
the brave “Boys in Blue,” and of their homes and dear
ones they would soon see.</p>

<p>But when the Un-ion troops were on their way
North, a few weeks lat-er, May 23, 1865, and 65,000 of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
them in full strength and health marched in di-vis-ions,
in close lines, round the cap-i-tol at Wash-ing-ton,
A-bra-ham Lin-coln, the “well be-loved,” was not there
to see them. His work was done. He had gone to
his Re-ward.</p>

<p>On Good Fri-day, A-pril 14, 1865, it was four years
from the “Sur-ren-der of Fort Sum-ter.” Ma-jor An-der-son
had, then, when the foe’s guns struck the fort,
hauled down the Stars and Stripes, and with great care,
put the dear flag a-way to keep for a glad day which
should come, and a large throng of folks from the North
had come down to Port Roy-al and Charles-ton to
raise, with words of praise and pray-er, o’er the ru-ins
of Sum-ter, that same Flag of the Free in all its
beau-ty.</p>

<p>Words were read from the Bi-ble, and all there who
could sing, joined in a hymn. Then the Star Span-gled
Ban-ner was flung to the breeze by Gen. Rob-ert
An-der-son. The pa-tri-ot, Hen-ry Ward Bee-cher,
gave at that time one of his great o-ra-tions. All hearts
were thrilled.</p>

<p>The day was a glad one at the White House. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Pres-i-dent’s son, Capt. Rob-ert Lin-coln, of Grant’s
staff, came home that morn, and told the tale of the last
scene at Ap-po-mat-tox.</p>

<p>The fam-i-ly took break-fast and then the Pres-i-dent
spent an hour with Mr. Col-fax, the Speak-er of the
House. Grant came in and all were glad to see him.
At 11 A. M. the Cab-i-net met.</p>

<p>There were man-y themes to speak of at that time,
such as how to bring back the States which had left the
Un-ion and what to do with those who led the re-volt.</p>

<p>In these first mo-ments which came af-ter the long
four years of dark-ness, Lin-coln thought that the way
to win the heart of the South was to be kind, and trust
to their hon-or to stand by what the test of war had
done. Of course they had been in the wrong and had
lost their all, but, as broth-ers, the Pres-i-dent felt that it
was as much to the in-ter-est of the North as it was to
that of the South to take all means to heal wounds and
lead and help the weak till strength came to them a-gain.</p>

<p>It was but a few nights be-fore, on A-pril 11, that
the Pres-i-dent said words of this sort to the crowds
which stormed the White House. In all the land,
where true hearts beat for the Un-ion, there was joy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Bells rang, guns roared, and thanks went up to God for
the great work He had done.</p>

<p>Lin-coln stood at the cen-tral win-dow of the White
House and made his last pub-lic speech. It be-gan
with these words:</p>

<p>“We meet this e-ven-ing, not in sor-row, but in glad-ness
of heart.”</p>

<p>Then he went on to tell the peo-ple what he hoped
to do for those who had lost. He said that his Cab-i-net
was a-bout to meet, and the mem-bers of it would,
no doubt, join with him in plans to help the South and
bring a-bout a spir-it of true peace in the land.</p>

<p>There were some folks in the South at that time,
on-ly a small knot of them no doubt, who thought Pres-i-dent
Lin-coln was their arch foe. They bound them-selves
to-geth-er to do him and some of his best men all
the harm they could.</p>

<p>It was on the night of A-pril 14, 1865, af-ter the
meet-ing of the Cab-i-net in the morn-ing, that the
Pres-i-dent, with his wife and two young friends, went
to see a play. Mr. Lin-coln felt wea-ry and would
have liked to stay at home. He had been out to drive
that af-ter-noon with his wife, and to the throngs of folks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
who saw and greet-ed him then he had bowed, smiled,
and, here and there, said a kind word.</p>

<div class="caption">ABRAHAM LINCOLN AS HE LOOKED IN 1865.</div>
</div>

<p>But it was not for him to rest at home that night.
He had giv-en his word that he would go to Ford’s
The-a-tre. Gen. and Mrs. Grant hoped to join the
Lin-colns in their box, but at the last mo-ment they
had to leave town.</p>

<p>The thought of see-ing two men so great as Lin-coln
and Grant to-geth-er on that night drew a vast throng
to Ford’s. Cheer af-ter cheer went up as all rose when
the Pres-i-dent came in. The band played “Hail to
the Chief,” and all hearts were glad. The Pres-i-dent
bowed and took his seat, smil-ing as the first pleas-ing
act was played.</p>

<p>Then, just as the cur-tain rose on the sec-ond scene
of the last act, the sound of a pis-tol’s re-port fell on the
air. At first it was thought to have been part of the
play; then a man was seen to leap from the Pres-i-dent’s
box and fall down up-on the stage, with a knife
in his hand, call-ing out the Lat-in words “Sic sem-per
ty-ran-nis,” which mean “Thus al-ways to ty-rants.”</p>

<p>Some one shout-ed “He has shot the Pres-i-dent—!”
Friends flew to the box and three ar-my sur-geons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
made their way through the crowd and helped take the
great and good man, who now was near his end, out to
a small house a-cross the street.</p>

<p>When dawn came and lamps grew dim, A-bra-ham
Lin-coln’s pulse be-gan to fail. Soon a calm look of
peace came up-on his worn face and he was gone.</p>

<p>The bad man who shot Lin-coln was one of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
knot of folks who had sworn to do him, and some of
his Cab-i-net, harm. They said that by so do-ing they
would “a-venge the South.” Oth-er good men be-sides
the Pres-i-dent were struck that night, but the Pres-i-dent,
a-lone, met his death wound.</p>

<p>Those who had made the plot to do that foul deed
were soon caught and put to death.</p>

<p>As the news went forth of the tra-gic death of A-bra-ham
Lin-coln the land stood a-ghast with awe. Bells
tolled, work stopped, and grief filled all hearts.</p>

<p>As the fun-er-al pro-ces-sion moved from the White
House to the church, it was seen that the es-cort was a
reg-i-ment of black men, whose free-dom from sla-ver-y
had come from him whose voice and hand were now
stilled by death.</p>

<p>The State of Il-li-nois said the last rest-ing place of
A-bra-ham Lin-coln must be on that soil. Then a
group of men in high pla-ces, Ad-mir-als of the Na-vy,
Gen-er-als of the Ar-my, with States-men and oth-ers
made a guard of hon-or, and went on that long jour-ney
to the tomb with the pre-cious dust, stop-ping in man-y
cit-ies that peo-ple might look once more on the dead
form of the man who led all oth-er men.</p>

<p>On May 14, 1865, the great Cap-tain, his life work
done, was laid to rest in Oak Ridge Cem-e-te-ry,
Spring-field, Il-li-nois.</p>

<p>The ser-vice was plain. There was a hymn, a pray-er,
a few words, then the read-ing of Lin-coln’s sec-ond
in-au-gu-ral ad-dress.</p>

<p>Notes of sym-pa-thy came to the U-ni-ted States from
rul-ers of oth-er lands. It seemed as if all the world laid
wreaths up-on the bier of A-bra-ham Lin-coln.</p>
